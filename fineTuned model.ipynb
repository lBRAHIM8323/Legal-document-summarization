Andley and Rameshwar Nath, for the respondent.\\nJanuary 22.\\nThe following Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR J.\\nThe respondent, a scheduled bank, sued the appellant in the court of the Civil Judge, Sitapore in Uttar Pradesh, for the recovery of money due under an instrument of mortgage.\\nThe appellant contested the suit on several grounds one of which was that he was entitled to relief under the Uttar Pradesh Zamindar \\'s Debt Reduction Act (U.P. XV of 1953) which reduced the amount recoverable on a debt as defined in it.\\nNow a debt was defined in the Act in these terms: 2(f): \"debt\" means an advance in cash or in kind and includes any transaction which is in substance a debt but does not include an advance as aforesaid made on or after the first day of July, 1952 or a debt due to (i) the Central Government or Government of any State ; (ii) a local authority; (iii) a scheduled bank; (iv) a co operative society; and 1152 (v) a waqf, trust or endowment for a charitable or religious purpose only.\\n(vi) a person, where the debt was advanced on his behalf by the Court of Wards to a ward.\\nAs the respondent was a scheduled bank the debt due to it from the appellant was not a debt within this definition and consequently, no relief would appear to be available to the appellant under the Act in respect of that debt.\\nThe appellant, however, contended that the definition in so far as it excluded certain debts offended article 14 of the Constitution in as much as it made an arbitrary distinction between several classes of debtors and denied the excluded debtors, the equal protection of the law and that hence that portion of the definition which excluded certain debts was invalid and should be struck out and the rest of the definition should be left as operative.\\nIf the appellant \\'s contention was justified, the definition would have to run as follows: \"debt\" means an advance in cash or in coin and includes any transaction which is in substance a debt, and would then include the debt due by the appellant to the respondent.\\nIf this was the correct position, then the appellant would be entitled to all the reliefs granted by the Act.\\nThis defence, therefore, raised a question as to the validity of a provision in the Act.\\nSo the appellant made an application to the Civil Judge, Sitapur, under the proviso to section 113 of the Code of Civil Procedure asking him to state a case for the opinion of the High Court at Allahabad to which he was subordinate as to the invalidity of the impugned portion of the definition.\\nThat proviso is in these terms: Provided that where the Court is satisfied that a case pending before it involves a question as to the validity of any Act, Ordinance or Regulation or of any provision contained in an Act, Ordinance or Regulation, the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, and is of opinion that such Act, Ordinance, Regulation or provision is invalid or inoperative, but has not been so declared by 1153 the High Court to which that Court is subordinate or by the Supreme Court, the Court shall state a case setting out its opinion and the reasons therefor, and refer the same for the opinion of the High Court.\\nThe learned Civil Judge took the view that the impugned portion of the definition infringed article 14 of the Constitution as it made an arbitrary distinction between several classes of debtors and was therefore invalid, but he held that it was not necessary for the disposal of the case to decide such question of invalidity because even if it was decided in favour of the appellant, the result would be to exclude the entire definition from the Act as the offending portion was not severable from the rest and the appellant would, therefore, be in any event left without the protection of the Act.\\nIn this view of the matter he held that the proviso to section 113 of the Code did not apply and dismissed the application under it.\\nThe appellant then made an application to the High Court at Allahabad for a revision of the order of the learned Civil Judge.\\nHe at the same time made another application to the High Court under article 228 of the Constitution.\\nThat article is in these terms: If the High Court is satisfied that a case pending in a court subordinate to it involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution the determination of which is necessary for the disposal of the case, it shall withdraw the case and may (a) either dispose of the case itself, or (b) determine the said question of law and return the case to the court from which the case has been so withdrawn together with a copy of its judgment on such question, and the said court shall on receipt thereof proceed to dispose of the case in conformity with such judgment.\\nThe appellant in the latter application prayed that the High Court might be pleased to withdraw the case and either dispose it of itself, or determine the question of the validity of the defintion of debt in the Act and return the case to the court of the Civil Judge, 1154 Sitapur, for final disposal in accordance with such determination.\\nThe High Court disposed of both the applications by one judgment.\\nIt held that there was no dispute as to the constitutional principle which was clear, namely, that every citizen was entitled to the equal protection of the laws and that any enactment which infringed that principle, is to that extent void, and that the only dispute was whether the impugned portion of the definition of a \" debt \" in the Act was severable from the rest and that was not a question of the interpretation of any provision of the Constitution but one of the construction of the Act itself.\\nThe High Court also held that even if any question of the interpretation of the Constitution arose, a determination of that question was not necessary for the dispogal of the case.\\nIn this view of the matter the High Court dismissed the application in revision and also that under article 228.\\nFrom this judgment the present appeal has been filed.\\nIt seems clear to us that the question raised by the appellant in this case comes within the proviso to section 113 of the Code as also article 228 of the Constitution.\\nThe question contemplated by the proviso to section 113 of the Code is as to the validity of an Act or of a provision in it while article 228 of the Constitution has in view a question as to the interpretation of the Constitution.\\nNow the question raised in the present case is as to the validity of a provision in the Zamindar \\'s Debt Reduction Act.\\nThis question is, however, also a question as to the interpretation of the Constitution, for the validity of the provision is challenged on the ground that it contravenes an article of the Constitution.\\nThe point that really arises in this appeal is whether it is necessary for the disposal of the case to decide the question of the validity of a portion of the definition of a debt in the Act .\\nAll other conditions necessary for an order being made under the proviso to section 113 of the Code or article 228 of the Constitution exist and as to this there is no serious dispute.\\nIt is 1155 not necessary for us therefore to discuss these conditions.\\nThe courts below held that in either view of the question of the validity of the impugned portion of the definition of a debt, the appellant would be without, the remedy which he sought, because that portion of the definition was not severable from the rest, and therefore it was not necessary to decide that question to dispose of the case.\\nWe are unable to agree with this view.\\nThe question of the validity of the definition in so far as it excluded certain debts having been raised and pressed by the appellant, it had to be decided by the court.\\nWithout a decision of that question the case could not be disposed of.\\nThe fact that in the view of the court the impugned part of the% definition was not severable from the rest and there \\' fore in any view of the question as to the validity of the impugned part, the appellant would not get any relief, did not alter the position.\\nThe question as to the severability of the impugned part of the definition from the rest would arise only after it had been decided that the impugned part was invalid and so to be able to say that the impugned part of the definition was not severable from the rest, it had first to be held that that part was invalid.\\nIt could not be said that as the impugned part was not severable from the rest it was not necessary for the disposal of the case to decide the question of the validity of the impugned part.\\nWe, therefore, hold that it is necessary to decide the question of the validity of the impugned part of the definition to dispose of the case.\\nThis appeal is hence allowed.\\nThe High Court will withdraw the case and either dispose it of itself or determine the question of the validity of the definition of a debt in the Zamindar \\'s Debt Reduction Act and return the case to the Civil Judge, Sitapur, for disposal in accordance with its determination of the \\' question.\\nThe appellant will get the costs of this appeal.\\nAppeal allowed.\\n', 'ed Case No.7 of 1987 In Transfer Petition No. 390 of 1986.\\nDr. Y.S Chitale, T .U. Mehta and R.P. Kapur for the Petitioners N.N. Keshwani, R.N. Keshwani, Ms. Madhu Moolchandani and K. Rajendra Chodhary for the Respondents.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN, J.\\nThe principal question in controversy in this petition under article 226 of the Constitution filed by the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd., a Government of India undertaking, which has been transferred from the High Court of Bombay to this Court under article 139A Of the Constitution, is whether the petitioner is entitled to the protection of PG NO 48 section 15A of the Bombay Rent, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, introduced by Maharashtra Act No. 17 of 1973 read with section 5 of the Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974.\\nPut very briefly, the essential facts are these.\\nThe Esso Eastern Inc., a company organised and existing under the laws of the State of Belaware, U.S.A., was carrying on, in India the business of distributing and marketing petroleum products manufactured by Esso Standard Refining Company of India Ltd., and Lube India Ltd. and had, for that purpose, established places of business in India.\\nThe company had taken several fiats in the Metropolitan City of Greater Bombay and elsewhere for accommodating their employees including Flat No.35 in Block No.8 in the housing colony known as Shyam Niwas situate at Warden Road, now called Bhulabhai Desai Road, Bombay on leave and licence basis for a period of one year in terms of an agreement in writing dated 26th November, 1968 from Smt.\\nNanki M. Malkani.\\nrespondent No. 2 herein.\\nOn 4th December.\\n1968 respondent No 1 Shyam Co operative Housing Society Ltd. passed a Resolution admitting petitioner No. 2 T.J. Nansukhani, and employee of the company as a nominal member of the society though he was not the licensee The company on 16th January, 1970 exercised the option of renewal of the licence for another year i.e. till 30th November 1970.\\nOn 29th November, 1971, respondent No. 2 Smt.\\nNanki M. Malkani addressed a letter to the company intimating that the agreement for leave and licence was due to expire on that date and accordingly the period of the said licence was renewed, yearly, from time to time to time years on the expiry of each term of licence i.e. on 30th November, 1972 and 30th November, 1972 and 30th November, 1973.\\nIn the meanwhile, the State Legislature of Maharashtra enacted Act No. 17 of 1973.\\nThe amendment Act also made consequential changes to which we shall presently refer.\\nUndoubtedly, the Esso Standard Inc. was in occupation of the flat in question as on 1st February, 1973 and thus acquired the status of a tenant under section 15A of the Act.\\nOn 13th March.\\nthe Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974 was brought into force.\\nAs from that date.\\nthe Central Government by virtue of sub section\\n(1) of section 5 of the Act was deemed to be the tenant of the flat in question.\\nOn 9th April.\\n1975, respondent No. 2 Smt.\\nNanki M. Malkani sent a communication to the petitioner affirming the terms and conditions of the licence.\\nAgain, on 24th March 1975, she addressed a letter confirming that she had given the aforesaid flat to Esso Eastern Inc. in December 1968 on leave and licence basis and the petitoner PG NO 49 being the successor in tittle of that company had been occupying the flat as licensee on the same terms and conditions.\\nOn 11th September, 1980, the society passed a resolution calling upon the petitioner Corporation to vacate the said premises and directing that respondent No. 2 Smt.\\nNanki M. Malkani should herself occupy the flat.\\nUpon failure of the Corporation to vacate the premises, the society on 15th September, 1980 filed an application under section 9I(I) of the Maharashtra Co operative Societies Act, 1960 before the 3rd Co operative Court, Bombay for eviction of the petitioner and its employee.\\nOn 7th January, 1981, petitioner No. I permitted another employee to occupy the flat.\\nThe 3rd Co operative Court, Bombay after consideration of the evidence adduced by the parties, by its well reasoned judgment dated 6th June, 1983 dismissed the claims of the society holding inter alia that Esso Eastern Inc. was in occupation of the flat in dispute under a subsisting licence as on 1st February, 1973 and thus got the protection available to a licensee under section I5A of the Bombay Rent Act and the said protection could not be taken away merely by the society making a claim for eviction under section 91(I) of the Act.\\nAggrieved, the society went up in appeal to the Maharashtra State Co operative Appellate Court which by its judgment dated 17th March, 19X4 allowed the appeal and decreed the claim of the society requiring petitioner No. 1 Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. to vacate Flat No. 35 in Block No. 8 of the society building with a further direction that respondent No. 2 Smt.\\nNanki M. Malkani should occupy the flat in question herself.\\nI hereupon, the petitioner moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for an appropriate writ, direction or order for quashing the impugned judgment and order passed by the Maharashtra State Co operative Appellate Court.\\nThis petition mainly raises three questions.\\nThey are [1] Whether the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited being a successor in interest of the Esso Eastern Inc. the licensee, was entitled to the protection of section 15A of the Bombay Rents Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947, introduced by the Maharashtra Act No. 17 of 1973, having regard to the fact that the Esso Eastern Inc. was in occupation of the flat in dispute under a subsisting licence as existing on 1st February 1973 (2) Whether the Maharashtra State operative Appellate Court was justified in holding that a licence being purely personal.\\nupOn acquisitiOn of the Esso Eastern Inc. by the Central Government under the Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974, the agreement for leave and licence as existing on the appointed day i.e. 13th March, 1974 under section 2 (a) of that Act, stood extinguished and therefore the right acquired by Esso PG NO 50 Eastern Inc. under section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act of being a protected tenant in relation to the flat in question, could not stand transferred to, or be vested in, the Central Government under section 3 of the Acquisition Act.\\nWas it also justified in holding that although the Esso Eastern Inc. was deemed to be a tenant of the disputed flat under section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act, the Central Government could not be deemed to have become the tenant thereof under sub section\\n(I) of section 5 of the Acquisition Act merely because prior to the enactment of section ISA of the Bombay Rent Act the premises were held by Esso Eastern Inc. on an agreement for leave and licence? (3) Whether a claim for ejectment of an occupant of a flat in a cooperative housing society having been let into possession of the premises under an agreement for leave and licence executed between it and a member of the society, by virtue of its employee having become a nominal member thereof, is a \\'dispute touching the business of the society \\' within the meaning of section 9 (1) of the Act.\\nIn the view that we take on the first two questions, there is no need to answer the third which is already covered by the decision of this Court in O N. Bhatnagar vs Smt.\\nRukibai Narsindas & Ors.\\n[ ; The statutory provisions bearing on these questions are set out below.\\nThe relevant provision in sub section\\n[I] of section 91 of the Act, prior to its amendment, provided: \"91 (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force, any dispute touching the parties to the dispute . .to the Registrar if both the parties thereto are one or other of the following: (a) a society (b) a member, past member or a person claiming through a member . .\\nThe definition of the term \\'landlord \\' as contained in section 5(3) of the Bombay Rent Act was amended to include in respect of a licensee deemed to be tenant by section 15A, the licenser who has given such licence \\'.\\nThe expression licensee \\' as defined in sub section\\n(4A) thereof introduced by the Amending Act, insofar as material, reads as follows: \"(4A) \\'licensee \\', in respect of any premises or any part thereof, means the person who is in occupation of the pre PG NO 51 mises or such part, as the case may be, under a subsisting agreement for licence given for a licence fee or charge \\' and includes any person in such occupation of any premises or part thereof in a building vesting in or leased to a cooperative housing society registered or deemed to be registered under the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960; but does not include a paying guest, a member of a family residing together, a person in the service or employment of the licensor etc; . and the expressions \"licence\", \"licenser\" and \"premises given on licence \\' shall be construed accordingly.\\n\" Sub section\\n(1) of section 15A of the Bombay Rent, as introduced by the Maharashtra Act No. 17 of 1973 provides: \\'15A(1).\\nNotwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Act or anything contrary in any other law for the time being in force, or in any contract, where any person is on February 1. 1973 in occupation of any premises, or any part thereof which is not less than a room, as a licensee he shall on that date be deemed to have become, for the purposes of this Act, the tenant of the landlord, in respect of the premises or part thereof, in his occupation.\\n\" Sec.\\n28(1) of the Act insofar as material reads.\\n\"28 (1).\\nNotwithstanding anything contained in any law and notwithstanding that by reason of the amount of the claim or for any other reason, the suit or proceeding would not, but.\\nfor this provision be within its jurisdiction.\\n(a) in Greater Bombay, the Court of Small Causes Bombay, [aa] [b] shall have jurisdiction to entertain and try any suit or proceeding between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery of rent or possession of any premises to which any of the provisions of this Part apply . .and to decide any application made under this Act and to deal with any claim PG NO 52 or question arising out of this Act or any of its provisions and . no other court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any such suit, proceeding or application or to deal with such claim or question.\\n\" We must then refer to the relevant provisions of the Esso Eastern Inc. The avowed object and purpose of the Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974, as reflected in the long title is to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the right, title and interest of Esso Eastern Inc., the foreign company, in relation to its undertakings in India with a view to ensuring co ordinated distribution and utilisation of petroleum products distributed and marketed in India by Esso Eastern Inc. and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.\\nThe preamble to the Act is in these terms: \"Whereas Esso Eastern Inc. a foreign company, is carrying on, in India, the business of distributing and marketing petroleum products manufactured by Esso Standard Refining Company of India Limited and Lube India Limited, and has, for that purpose, established places of business at Bombay and other places in India; And whereas it is expedient in the public interest that the undertakings, in India, of Esso Eastern Inc. should he acquired in order to ensure that the ownership and control of the petroleum products distributed and marketed in India by the said company are vested in the State and thereby so distributed as best to subserve the common good;\" Section 3 of the Act provides: \"3. Transfer and vesting in the Central Government of the undertakings of Esso in India On the appointed day, the right, title and interest of Esso, in relation to its undertakings in India, shall stand transferred to and shall stand in, the Central Government.\\nThe Act received the assent of the President on the 13th March, 1974 and published on that day became the appointed day, as defined in section 2(a) of the Act.\\nSub section\\n( 1) of section 5 provides: \"5.\\nCentral Government to be lessee or tenant under certain circumstances (l) Where any property is held in India by Esso under any lease or under any right of tenancy PG NO 53 the Central Government shall on and from the appointed day, be deemed to have become the lessee or tenant, as the case may be, in respect of such property as if the lease or tenancy in relation to such property had been granted to the Central Government, and thereupon all the rights under such lease or tenancy shall be deemed to have been transferred to and vested in the Central Government.\" Section 7(1) provides that, notwithstanding anything contained in sections 3 4 and 6, the Central Government may, if it is satisfied that a Government company is willing to comply, or has complied, with such terms and conditions as that Government may think fit to impose direct, by notification, that the right, title and interest and the liabilities of Esso in relation to any undertaking in India shall, instead of continuing to vest in the Central Government, vest in the Government company either on the date of the notification or on such earlier or later date (not being a date earlier than the appointed day) as may be specified in the notification.\\nThe Act makes provision that if there was any dispute with regard to what is vested in the Central Government, the proper forum was the Central Government for taking a decision.\\n19 of the Act reads as under: \"19.\\nPower to remove difficulties If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government may, by order, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.\\nremove the difficulty; Provided that no such order shall be made after the expiry of a period of two years from the appointed day.\\n\" In exercise of the powers conferred by sub s.(l) of section 7 of the Act, the Central Government, in the Ministry of Petroleum & Chemicals issued a notification No. GSR 131(F.) dated 14th March 1974.\\nthat on being satisfied that Esso Standard Refining Company of India Limited? a Government company, is willing to comply with the terms and India imposed by the Central Government, hereby directs that the right, title and interest and the liabilities of Esso Eastern Inc., in relation to its undertakings in l ndia, shall, instead of continuing to vest in the Central Government.\\nvest, w.e.f.\\nthe 15th day of March, 1974, in Esso Standard Refining Company of India Limited.\\nIndubitably.\\nas on the appointed day i.e. 13th March, 1974 PG NO 54 under section 2(a) of the Acquisition Act, the Esso Eastern Inc. had acquired the status of a protected tenant under section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act and the tenancy rights so acquired in relation to the flat in question stood transferred to, and became vested in, the Central Government.\\nBy virtue of the aforesaid notification issued under section 7(1) of the Act, the rights of tenancy in the 13 flat in question instead of continuing to vest in the Central Government became vested in Esso Standard Refining Company of India Limited, a Government of India undertaking, w.e.f.\\n15th March, 1974.\\nIt is also necessary to mention that the Central Government held, in the name of the President, 74% of the equity share capital of the Esso Standard Refining Company of India Limited, which therefore became a Government company as defined by section 617 of the .\\nOn 12th July, 1974 the Company Law Board, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub sections\\n(1) and (2) of section 396 of the , read with the notification of the Government of India in the Department of Company Affairs No. GSR 443(E) dated 18th October, 1972, made Lube India Limited a Esso Standard Refining company of India Limited (Amalgamation) Order, 1974.\\n(3) of the said Order provided that as from the appointed day, the undertaking of Lube India Limited shall stand transferred to, and vest in, Esso Standard Refining Company of India Limited.\\nAs a result of the amalgamation of the two companies, the name of Esso Standard Refining Company of India Limited was changed to Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited.\\nIt is therefore evident that petition No. 1 Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited, a Government of India undertaking, is a successor in interest of Esso Eastern Inc. which acquired the status of a deemed tenant under section ISA of the Bombay Rent Act, which right devolved on the Central Government under section 6(1) of the Acquisition Act.\\nUpon these facts and the statutory provisions, the 3rd Cooperative Court rightly concluded as under: \"Thus, it is clear that there was a subsisting licence in favour of opponent No. 3 as on 1.2.73.\\nThe definition \\'Licensee \\' as given in Section 5(4A) of the Rent Act includes inter alia a person in occupation of premises of a co operative housing society.\\nPG NO 55 My findings on this issue are that the opponent No. 3 has a right to the premises against opponent No. 1 as protected tenant under Section 15A of the Rent Act.\\n\" In dealing with the question, it observed: \"The Supreme Court has clearly observed that the protection given to a licensee under a valid licence as on 1.2.73 under Act 17 of the amended Rent Act is available to a licensee of any premises or any part thereof in a building vesting in or leased to a co operative housing society.\\nThis protection given to a licensee in the position mentioned above cannot be taken away merely by the society filing the case against the member and occupant for reliefs to the opponent member.\\nThe provisions of the two legislations are to be harmoniously interpreted and such harmonious interpretation is possible.\\nIn case the occupant of a premises gets protection under section 15A of the Rent Act against the member, the society can implement the provisions of section 2( l6) of the Maharashtra Co operative Societies Act, 1960 by determining the rights of the member and admitting a new member for the premises.\\nHence, my finding on the second part of the issue are that the rights of opponent No. 3 cannot be determined without determining the rights of opponent No. I i.e. Nanki M. Malkani, a co partner member in the suit premises.\\n\" In view of these findings, the 3rd Co operative Court held in favour of the petitioner corporation and dismissed the claim for eviction filed by the society under section 9( l) of the Act.\\nCuriously enough, while allowing the appeal, the State Appellate Court has observed as follows: \"One thing is clear that Hindustan Petroleum took over the rights and liabilities of Esso Standard Eastern Co. We would like to point out that leave and licence agreement confers only a personal right to occupy . that right cannot be transferred nor it can be inherited by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation by virtue of the merger of Esso Company with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation.\\nUnder these circumstances it has to be noted that as soon as the Esso PG NO 56 Standard Eastern Co. was taken over by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, the rights under the leave and license agreement came to an end . . it cannot be said that it (Hindustan Petroleum Corporation) also took over the rights of Esso Standard Eastern Co. to occupy the flat under the leave and licence agreement.\\nAgain it observed: \" At P. 299 of the record there is a letter dated 24.3.80 written by respondent No. 1 to the personal adviser of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. In the first para of the said letter it is stated by respondent No. 1 that he has given the suit that to Esso Standard Eastern Inc. in December 1968 on leave and licence basis and that Hindustan Petroleum Corporation is the successor in title of the Esso Company and that Hindustan Petroleum Corporation is occupying the said flat: Probably in ignorance of this legal position, the respondent No. I wrote the above mentioned letter dated 24.\\n3.80 to Hindustan Petroleum Corporation .\\nEven supposing that respondent No. I intended that respondent No. 3 should continue as a licensee after Esso Standard Eastern Co. was taken over by respondent No. 3 it has to be noted that there was no separate leave and licence agreement with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation namely.\\nrespondent No. 3.\\nEven assuming for the sake of argument that respondent No. I intended that the flat should be occupied on leave and licence basis by respondent No. 3 that leave and licence agreement was terminated by respondent No. I by the above mentioned letter.\\n\" Further, it observed: \"However there is absolutely no evidence to show the licence was renewed, at any time.\\nThe evidence of the witness examined on behalf of respondent No. 2 clearly shows that there was no renewal of the leave and licence agreement respondent No. 3 the leave and licence agreement automatically came to an end . .under these circumstances we feel that the rights that were given under PG NO 57 the leave and licence agreement were not available to respondent No. 3\" Dr. Y.S. Chitale, learned counsel appearing for the petitioners rightly contends that the findings reached by the Appellate Court are manifestly erroneous and have caused a grave miscarriage of justice.\\nThe finding that there was no subsisting licence existing as on 1st February, 1973 to attract the provisions of section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act in the case of the petitioner Corporation is vitiated by its failure to give effect to the admission contained in the letter dated 24th March, 1980 written by respondent No. 2, Smt.\\nNanki M. Malkani which is to the effect: \"I had given the above flat to the then Esso Standard Inc. in December 1968 on leave and licence basis.\\nYou as a successor in title of that company have been occupying the flat as licensee on the same terms and conditions.\\nAs you and your predecessors in title are reputed organisation I had given the flat for your officers use in the expectation that you will return the flat.\\nwhen l require it for my own use.\\n\" Besides this letter, the learned counsel for the petitioners drew our attention to a sheaf of letters exchanged between respondent No. 2 Smt.\\nNanki M. Malkani and the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. showing that she accepted that there was subsisting agreement of leave and licence as late as 24th March, 1980 which must be necessary implication, give rise to the inference as to the existence of such a licence between its predecessor Esso Eastern Inc. as on 1st February, 1973 which conferred on it the status of a protected tenant under section 15A of the Act.\\nIndeed, the correspondence shows that it was at the behest of respondent No. 2 that every time on the expiry of a term of licence it came to be renewed from year to year till section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act was brought into force.\\nThereafter, the predecessor in interest of the petitioner, corporation was deemed to be her tenant under section I5A of the Bombay Rent Act.\\nFor instance, by letter dated 9th April, 1975 she wrote to the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. that the above flat had been in its possession since December 1, 1968.\\nAgain, by letter dated 15th November, 1976, she wrote to the Corporation forwarding the original bill of the society in support of her demand for payment of enhanced taxes and PG NO 58 charges.\\nIn view of these admissions made in these letters and more particularly in the letter dated 29th November, 1971 to Esso Eastern Inc. which reads as under: \"As the present agreement of leave and licence in regard to above flat is due to expire on 30th November, 1973 that is two years from hence, you would like me to give you an undertaking of renewal of this agreement to justify the expenditure being incurred by you now,\" the findings of the Appellate Court are clearly erroneous.\\nOn the other hand, it stands proved that Esso Eastern Inc. had acquired the status of deemed tenant or protected licensee under section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act as on 1st February, 1973.\\nThe findings of the Appellate Court to the contrary are therefore clearly erroneous.\\nWe are unable to sustain the view taken by the Appellate \\' Court in not giving effect to sub section\\n[1] of section 5 which vested the tenancy rights in relation to the flat in question on the Central Government as from appointed day.\\nWhile it is true that a licence being personal is not capable of being transferred; there was no warrant for the assumption by the Appellate Court that the licence stood extinguished with the acquisition of the right, title and interest of Esso Eastern Inc. under section 3 of the Acquisition Act.\\nThat Act came into force on 15th March, 1974 and in the meanwhile, the licensee Esso Eastern Inc. had already acquired the status of deemed tenant under section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act admittedly, there was a subsisting licence as on 1st February, 1973.\\nThe Appellate Court has also failed to appreciate that the name of Esso Eastern Inc. was changed to Esso Eastern Inc. by a Certificate of Amendment dated/22nd December, 1970 vide a Resolution passed by the Board of Directors of the Corporation on 15th December, 1970.\\nIn view of all this, the finding of the Appellate Court that the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. was entitled to the protection of section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act clearly borders on traversity and can hardly be swtained.\\nThe Appellate Court was clearly in error in not appreciating that section by 4. 3 of the Acquisition Act, the right, title and interest of Esso Eastern Inc. in relation to its undertakings in India, shall stand transferred to, and shall vest in, the Central Government as from the appointed day i.e. as from 13th March.\\nUnder sub section\\n(I) of section 5 thereof, the Central Government became the lessee or tenant, as the case may be.\\nBy sub section\\n(2) thereof, on the expiry of the term of any or tenancy refereed to in sub section\\n(1), such lease or tenancy shall, if PG NO 59 so desired by the Central Government, be renewed on the same terms and conditions on which the lease or tenancy was held by Esso immediately before the appointed day.\\nBy a notification issued on the next date, the right, title and interest of the Central Government became vested in Esso Standard Refining Company of India Ltd., a Government company, w.e.f. 15th March, 1974.\\nFurthermore, by reason of Lube India and Esso Standard Refining Company of India Ltd. Amalgamation Order, 1974 made by the Company Law Board under section 396 [1] & (2) of the , the undertaking of Lube lndia Ltd. vested in Esso Standard Refining Company of India Ltd. and immediately upon such transfer, the name of Esso Standard Refining Company of lndia Ltd., stood changed to Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. In the premises, petitioner No. 1 Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. is clearly protected under section 15A of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act.\\nIn that view of the matter, we do not think it necessary to deal with the contention as regards the applicability of section 91 of the Maharashtra Cooperative Societies Act, 1960.\\nAll aspects arising out of the submissions as to the jurisdiction of the Registrar under section 91(1) of the Act have already been considered by this Court on O.N. Bhatnagar \\'s case and we reiterate the principles laid down therein.\\nIn the result, the petition under article 226 of the Constitution succeeds and is allowed.\\nI he judgment and order passed by the Maharashtra State Co operative Appellate Court dated June 6, 1983 allowing the claim of respondent No. 1 Shyam Co operative Housing Society for eviction of the petitioners as also the proceedings initiated by it under section 91 of the Maharashtra Co operative Societies Act.\\n1960 are quashed.\\nY.

Pathak, J. gave a separate Opinion.\\n173 BHAGWATI, J.\\nThis petition for a writ of habeas corpus discloses a shocking state of affairs in regard to administration of justice in the State of Bihar.\\nAn alarmingly large number of men and women, children including, are behind prison bars for years awaiting trial in courts of law.\\nThe offences with which some of them are charged are trivial, which, even if proved, would not warrant punishment for more than a few months, perhaps for a year or two, and yet these unfortunate forgotten specimens of humanity are in jail, deprived of their freedom, for periods ranging from three to ten years without even as much as their trial having commenced.\\nIt is a crying shame on the judicial system which permits incarceration of men and women for such long periods of time without trial.\\nWe are shouting from house tops about the protection and enforcement of human rights.\\nWe are taking passionately and eloquently about the maintenance and preservation of basic freedoms.\\nBut, are we not denying human rights to these nameless persons who are languishing in jails for years for offences which perhaps they might ultimately be found not to have committed ? Are we not withholding basic freedoms from these neglected and helpless human beings who have been condemned to a life of imprisonment and degradation for years on end? Are expeditious trial and freedom from detention not part of human rights and basic freedoms ? Many of these unfortunate men and women must not even be remembering when they entered the jail and for what offence.\\nThey have over the years ceased to be human beings they are mere ticket numbers.\\nIt is high time that the public conscience is awakened and the Government as well as the judiciary begin to realise that in the dark cells of our prisons there are large numbers of men and women who are waiting patiently, impatiently perhaps, but in vain, for justice a commodity which is tragically beyond their reach and grasp.\\nLaw has become for them an instrument of injustice and they are helpless and despairing victims of the callousness of the legal and judicial system.\\nThe time has come when the legal and judicial system has to be revamped and restructured so that such injustices do not occur and disfigures the fair and otherwise luminous face of our nascent democracy.\\nThough we issued notice to the State of Bihar two weeks ago, it is unfortunate that on the 5th February, 1979 no one has appeared on behalf of the State and we must, therefore, at this stage proceed on the basis that the allegations contained in the issues of the Indian Express dated 8th and 9th January, 1979 which are incorporated in the writ petition are correct.\\nThe information contained in these newspaper cuttings is most distressing and it is sufficient to stir the consci 174 ence and disturb the equanimity of any socially motivated lawyer or judge.\\nSome of the undertrial prisoners whose names are given in the newspaper cuttings have been in jail for as many as 5, 7 or 9 years and a few of them, even more than 10 years, without their trial having begun.\\nWhat faith can these lost souls have in the judicial system which denies them a bare trial for so many years and keeps them behind bars, not because they are guilty, but because they are too poor to afford bail and the courts have no time to try them.\\nIt is a travesty of justice that many poor accused, \"little Indians, are forced into long cellular servitude for little offences\" because the bail procedure is beyond their meagre means and trials don \\'t commence and even if they do, they never conclude.\\nThere can be little doubt, after the dynamic interpretation placed by this Court on article 21 in Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India(1) that a procedure which keeps such large numbers of people behind bars without trial so long cannot possibly be regarded as \\'reasonable, just or fair \\' so as to be in conformity with the requirement of that Article.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, that the law as enacted by the Legislature and as administered by the courts must radically change its approach to pretrial detention and ensure \\'reasonable, just and fair \\' procedure which has creative connotation after Maneka Gandhi \\'s case supra.\\nNow, one reason why our legal and judicial system continually denies justice to the poor by keeping them for long years in pretrial detention is our highly unsatisfactory bail system.\\nIt suffers from a property oriented approach which seems to proceed on the erroneous assumption that risk of monetary loss is the only deterrent against fleeing from justice.\\nThe Code of Criminal Procedure, even after its re enactment, continues to adopt the same antiquated approach as the earlier Code enacted towards the end of the last century and where an accused is to be released on his personal bond, it insists that the bond should contain a monetary obligation requiring the accused to pay a sum of money in case he fails to appear at the trial.\\nMoreover, as if this were not sufficient deterrent to the poor, the courts mechanically and as a matter of course insist that the accused should produce sureties who will stand bail for him and these sureties must again establish their solvency to be able to pay up the amount of the bail in case the accused fails to appear to answer the charge.\\nThis system of bails operates very harshly against the poor and it is only the non poor who are able to take advantage of it by getting themselves released on bail.\\nThe poor find it difficult to furnish bail even without sureties because very often the amount of the bail fixed by the courts is so 175 unrealistically excessive that in a majority of cases the poor are unable to satisfy the police or the Magistrate about their solvency for the amount of the bail and where the bail is with sureties, as is usually the case, it becomes an almost impossible task for the poor to find persons sufficiently solvent to stand as sureties.\\nThe result is that either they are fleeced by the police and revenue officials or by touts and professional sureties and sometimes they have even to incur debts for securing their release or, being unable to obtain release, they have to remain in jail until such time as the court is able to take up their cases for trial, leading to grave consequences, namely, (1) though presumed innocent, they are subjected to psychological and physical deprivations of jail life, (2) they are prevented from contributing to the preparation of their defence and (3) they lose their job, if they have one, and are deprived of an opportunity to work to support themselves and their family members with the result that the burden of their detention almost invariably falls heavily on the innocent members of the family.\\nIt is hero that the poor find our legal and judicial system oppressive and heavily weighted against them and a feeling of frustration and despair occurs upon them as they find that they are helplessly in a position of inequality with the non poor.\\nThe Legal Aid Committee appointed by the Government of Gujarat under the chairmanship of one of us, Mr. Justice Bhagwati, emphasised this glaring inequality in the following words: \"The bail system, as we see it administered in the criminal courts today, is extremely unsatisfactory and needs drastic change.\\nIn the first place it is virtually impossible to translate risk of non appearance by the accused into precise monetary terms and even its basic premise that risk of financial loss is necessary to prevent the accused from fleeing is of doubtful validity.\\nThere are several considerations which deter an accused from running away from justice and risk of financial loss is only one of them and that too not a major one.\\nThe experience of enlightened Bail Projects in the United States such as Manhattan Bail Project and D. C. Bail Project shows that even without monetary bail it has been possible to secure the presence of the accused at the trial in quite a large number of cases.\\nMoreover, the bail system causes discrimination against the poor since the poor would not be able to furnish bail on account of their poverty while the wealthier persons otherwise similarly situate would be able to secure their freedom because they can afford to furnish bail.\\nThis discrimination arises even if the amount 176 of the bail is fixed by the Magistrate is not high, for a large majority of those who are brought before the Courts in criminal cases are so poor that they would find it difficult to furnish bail even in a small amount.\\n\" The Gujarat Committee also pointed out how the practice of fixing the amount of bail with reference to the nature of the charge without taking into account relevant factors, such as the individual financial circumstances of the accused and the probability of his fleeing before trial, is harsh and oppressive and discriminates against the poor: \"The discriminatory nature of the bail system becomes all the more acute by reason of the mechanical way in which it is custormarily operated.\\nIt is no doubt true that theoretically the Magistrate has broad discretion in fixing the amount of bail but in practice it seems that the amount of bail depends almost always on the seriousness of the offence.\\nIt is fixed according to a schedule related to the nature of the charge.\\nLittle weight is given either to the probability that the accused will attempt to flee before his trial or to his individual financial circumstances, the very factors which seem most relevant if the purpose of bail is to assure the appearance of the accused at the trial.\\nThe result of ignoring these factors and fixing the amount of bail mechanically having regard only to the seriousness of the offence is to discriminate against the poor who are not in the same position as the rich as regards capacity to furnish bail.\\nThe Courts by ignoring the differential capacity of the rich and the poor to furnish bail and treating them equally produce inequality between the rich and the poor: the rich who is charged with the same offence in the same circumstances is able to secure his release while the poor is unable to do so on account of his poverty.\\nThese are some of the major defects in the bail system as it is operated to day.\\n\" The same anguish was expressed by President Lyndon B. Johnson at the time of signing the Bail Reforms Act, 1966: \"Today, we join to recognize a major development in our system of criminal justice: the reform of the bail system.\\nThis system has endured archaic, unjust and virtually unexamined since the Judiciary Act of 1789.\\nThe principal purpose of bail is to insure that an accused person will return for trial if he is released after arrest.\\n177 How is that purpose met under the present system ? The defendant with means can afford to pay bail.\\nHe can afford to buy his freedom.\\nBut poorer defendant cannot pay the price.\\nHe languishes in jail weeks, months and perhaps even years before trial.\\nHe does not stay in jail because he is guilty.\\nHe does not stay in jail because any sentence has been passed.\\nHe does not stay in jail because he is any more likely to flee before trial.\\nHe stays in jail for one reason only because he is poor. .\" The bail system, as it operates today, is a source of great hardship to the poor and if we really want to eliminate the evil effects of poverty and assure a fair and just treatment to the poor in the administration of justice, it is imperative that the bail system should be thoroughly reformed so that it should be possible for the poor, as easily as the rich to obtain pretrial release without jeopardizing the interest of justice.\\nIt is high time that our Parliament realises that risk of monetary loss is not the only deterrent against fleeing from justice, but there are also other factors which act as equal deterrents against fleeing.\\nOurs is a socialist republic with social justice as the signature tune of our constitution and Parliament would do well to consider whether it would not be more consonant with the ethos of our constitution that instead of risk of financial loss, other relevant considerations such as family ties, roots in the community, job security, membership of stable organisations etc., should be the determinative factors in grant of bail and the accused should be in appropriate cases be released on his personal bond without monetary obligation.\\nOf course, it may be necessary in such a case to provide by an amendment of the penal law that if the accused wilfully fails to appear in compliance with the promise contained in his personal bond, he shall be liable to penal action.\\nBut even under the law as it stands today the courts must abandon the antiquated concept under which pretrial release is ordered only against bail with sureties.\\nThat concept is outdated and experience has shown that it has done more harm than good.\\nThe new insight into the subject of pretrial release which has been developed in socially advanced countries and particularly the United States should now inform the decisions of our Courts in regard to pretrial release.\\nIf the Court is satisfied, after taking into account, on the basis of information placed before it, that the accused has his roots in the community and is not likely to abscond, it can safely release the accused 178 on his personal bond.\\nTo determine whether the accused has his roots in the community which would deter him from fleeing, the Court should take into account the following factors concerning the accused: 1.\\nThe length of his residence in the community.\\nhis employment status, history and his financial condition, 3.\\nhis family ties and relationships, 4.\\nhis reputation, character and monetary condition, 5.\\nhis prior criminal record including any record or prior release on recognizance or on bail, 6.\\nthe identity of responsible members of the community who would vouch for his reliability.\\nthe nature of the offence charged and the apparent probability of conviction and the likely sentence in so far as these factors are relevant to the risk of non appearance, and 8.\\nany other factors indicating the ties of the accused to the community or bearing on the risk of wilful failure to appear.\\nIf the court is satisfied on a consideration of the relevant factors that the accused has his ties in the community and there is no substantial risk of non appearance, the accused may, as far as possible, be released on his personal bond.\\nOf course, if facts are brought to the notice of the court which go to show that having regard to the condition and background of the accused his previous record and the nature and circumstances of the offence, there may be a substantial risk of his non appearance at the trial, as for example, where the accused is a notorious bad character or a confirmed criminal or the offence is serious (these examples are only by way of illustration), the court may not release the accused on his personal bond and may insist on bail with sureties.\\nBut in the majority of cases, considerations like family ties and relationship, roots in the community, employment status etc. may prevail with the court in releasing the accused on his personal bond and particularly in cases where the offence is not grave and the accused is poor or belongs to a weaker section of the community, release on personal bond could, as far as possible, be preferred.\\nBut even while releasing the accused on personal bond it is necessary to caution the court that the amount of the bond which it 179 fixes should not be based merely on the nature of the charge.\\nThe decision as regards the amount of the bond should be an individualised decision depending on the individual financial circumstances of the accused and the probability of his absconding.\\nThe amount of the bond should be determined having regard to these relevant factors and should not be fixed mechanically according to a schedule keyed to the nature of the charge.\\nOtherwise, it would be difficult for the accused to secure his release even by executing a personal bond.\\nMoreover, when the accused is released on his personal bond, it would be very harsh and oppressive if he is required to satisfy the court and what we have said here in regard to the court must apply equally in relation to the police while granting bail that he is solvent enough to pay the amount of the bond if he fails to appear at the trial and in consequence the bond is forfeited.\\nThe inquiry into the solvency of the accused can become a source of great harassment to him and often result in denial of bail and deprivation of liberty and should not, therefore, be insisted upon as a condition of acceptance of the personal bond.\\nWe have no doubt that if the system of bail, even under the existing law, is administered in the manner we have indicated in this judgment, it would go a long way towards relieving hardship of the poor and help them to secure pretrial release from incarceration.\\nIt is for this reason we have directed the undertrial prisoners whose names are given in the two issues of the Indian Express should be released forthwith on their personal bond.\\nWe should have ordinarily said that personal bond to be executed by them should be with monetary obligation, but we directed as an exceptional measure that there need be no monetary obligation in the personal bond because we found that all these persons have been in jail without trial for several years, and in some cases for offences for which the punishment would in all probability be less than the period of their detention and moreover, the order we were making was merely an interim order.\\nThe peculiar facts and circumstances of the case dictated such an unusual course.\\nThere is also one other infirmity of the legal and judicial system which is responsible for this gross denial of justice to the undertrial prisoners and that is the notorious delay in disposal of cases.\\nIt is a bad reflection on the legal and judicial system that the trial of an accused should not even commence for a long number of years.\\nEven a delay of one year in the commencement of the trial is bad enough; how much worse could it be when the delay is as long as 3 or 5 or 7 or even 10 years.\\nSpeedy trial is of the essence of criminal justice and there can be no doubt that delay in trial by itself constitutes denial 180 of justice.\\nIt is interesting to note that in the United States, speedy trial is one of the constitutionally guaranteed rights.\\nThe Sixth Amendment to the Constitution provides that \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\\n\" So also Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides that: \"every one arrested or detained shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial.\\n\" We think that even under our Constitution, though speedy trial is not specifically enumerated as a fundamental right, it is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21 as interpreted by this Court in Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India.\\nWe have held in that case that Article 21 confers a fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and it is not enough to constitute compliance with the requirement of that Article that some semblance of a procedure should be prescribed by law, but that the procedure should be \"reasonable, fair and just\".\\nIf a person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure which is not \"reasonable, fair or just\", such deprivation would be violative of his fundamental right under Article 21 and he would be entitled to enforce such fundamental right and secure his release.\\nNow obviously procedure prescribed by law for depriving a person of his liberty cannot be \\'reasonable, fair or just \\' unless that procedure ensures a speedy trial for determination of the guilt of such person.\\nNo procedure which does not ensure a reasonable quick trial can be regarded as \\'reasonable, fair or just \\' and it would fall foul of Article 21.\\nThere can, therefore, be no doubt that speedy trial and by speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial, is an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21.\\nThe question which would, however, arise is as to what would be the consequence if a person accused of an offence is denied speedy trial and is sought to be deprived of his liberty by imprisonment as a result of a long delayed trial in violation of his fundamental right under Article 21.\\nWould he be entitled to be released unconditionally freed from the charge levelled against him on the ground that trying him after an unduly long period of time and convicting him after such trial would constitute violation of his fundamental right under Article 21 ? That is a question we shall have to consider when we hear the writ petition on merits on the adjourned date.\\nBut one thing is certain and we cannot impress it too strongly on the State Government that it is high time that the State Government realised its responsibility to the people in the matter of admini 181 stration of justice and set up more courts for the trial of cases.\\nWe may point out that it would not be enough merely to establish more courts but the State Government would also have to man them by competent judges and whatever is necessary for the purpose of recruiting competent judges, such as improving their conditions of service, would have to be done by the State Government, if they want to improve the system of administration of justice and make it an effective instrument for reaching justice to the large masses of people for whom justice is to day a meaningless and empty word.\\nThese are the reasons for which we made our order dated 5th February, 1979.\\nWe shall now proceed to hear the writ petition on 19th February, 1979.\\nPATHAK, J.\\nIt is indisputable that an unnecessarily prolonged detention in prison of undertrials before being brought to trial is an affront to all civilized norms of human liberty.\\nAny meaningful concept of individual liberty which forms the bedrock of a civilized legal system must view with distress patently long periods of imprisonment before persons awaiting trial can receive the attention of the administration of justice.\\nThe primary principle of criminal law is that imprisonment may follow a judgment of guilt.\\nBut should not precede it.\\nBut there is another principle which makes it desirable to ensure that the accused is present to receive his sentence in the event of being found guilty.\\nNow, the Code of Criminal Procedure, both the old Code and the new, include provision for the release of a person on bail or on the execution of a bond without sureties for his appearance.\\nNonetheless, as appears prima facie from the record before us, a large number of persons whose names, find mention in copies of the Indian Express of January 8 and 9, 1979, have been in prison for long year without even being brought to trial.\\nAlthough sufficient opportunity was given to the State of Bihar to meet the allegations made, it is unfortunate that no one has appeared on behalf of the State.\\nIn view of the importance of the questions arising on the habeas corpus petition, we have provided further opportunity to the State to appear and accordingly have posted the petition for final hearing on February 19, 1979.\\nBut at the same time we see no reason why interim relief should be denied to these undertrials.\\nAfter carefully considering what has been said in respect of each individual undertrial, we have considered it appropriate, in the interests of justice, to make the order of February 5, 1979 directing the release of the persons mentioned in that order on their executing a personal bond.\\nThe order is somewhat unusual in that it directs that the personal bond to be taken in each 182 case should not be based on any monetary obligation.\\nThe condition has been included as an exceptional measure, under the persuasive pressure of the particular facts and circumstance of the case.\\nIn regard to the exercise of the judicial power to release a prisoner awaiting trial on bail or on the execution of a personal bond without sureties for his appearance, I have to say this briefly.\\nThere is an amplitude of power in this regard within the existing provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and it is for the Courts to fully acquaint themselves with the nature and extent of their discretion in exercising it.\\nI think it is no longer possible to countenance a mechanical exercise of the power.\\nWhat should be the amount of security required or the monetary obligation demanded in a bond is a matter calling for the careful consideration of several factors.\\nThe entire object being only to ensure that the undertrial does not flee or hide himself from trial, all the relevant considerations which enter into the determination of that question must be taken into account.\\nA synoptic impression of what the considerations could be may be drawn from the following provision in the United States Bail Reform Act of 1966: \"In determining which conditions of releases will reasonably assure appearance, the judicial officer shall, on the basis of available information, take into account the nature and circumstances of the offence charged, the weight of the evidence against the accused, the accused \\'s family ties, employment, financial resources, character and mental condition, the length of his residence in the community, his record of convictions, and his record of appearance at court proceedings or of flight to avoid prosecution or failure to appear at court proceedings.\\nThese are considerations which should be kept in mind when determining the amount of the security or monetary obligation.\\nPerhaps, if this is done the abuses attendant on the prevailing system of pretrial release in India could be avoided or, in any event, greatly reduced See Moti Ram and Others vs State of Madhya Pradesh.\\nI consider it desirable to refrain from making any final comment or observation on the legality and propriety of the continued detention of the undertrial prisoners whether on the ground of infringement 183 of Article 21 of the Constitution or on other grounds.\\nThat, I think, should await the final determination of the habeas corpus petition.\\nThese are the reasons which have influenced me in making the order dated February 5, 1979.\\nWhile concluding, it seems desirable to draw attention to the absence of an explicit provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the release, in appropriate cases, of an undertrial prisoner on his bond without sureties and without any monetary obligation.\\nThere is urgent need for a clear provision.\\nUndeniably, the thousands of undertrial prisoners lodged in Indian prisons today include many who are unable to secure their release before trial because of their inability to produce sufficient financial guarantee for their appearance.\\nWhere that is the only reason for their continued incarceration, there may be good ground for complaining of invidious discrimination.\\nThe more so under a constitutional system which promises social equality and social justice to all of its citizens.\\nThe deprivation of liberty for the reason of financial poverty only is an incongruous element in a society aspiring to the achievement of these constitutional objectives.\\nThere are sufficient guarantees for appearance in the host of considerations to which reference has been made earlier and, it seems to me, our law makers would take an important step in defence of individual liberty if appropriate provision was made in the statute for non financial releases.\\n', 'ivil Appeal No. 764 (N) of 1975.\\nFrom the Judgment and Decree dated 30.11.1973 of the Kerala High Court in A.S.

Victorial Steamship Company as agents of the said owner of the vessel in London on 27.1.\\n1964; that as per clause 3 of the bill of lading the court at Cochin had no jurisdiction and only English courts had jurisdiction; and that as per the char terparty and clause 4 of the bill of lading the reined.? of the first respondent, if any, was against the owner who alone was liable and not against the appellant charterer of the vessel.\\nExhibit D 1 is the photostate copy of the char terparty concluded in London on 27.1.\\n1964 and Exhibit P 1 to P3 are the 3 bills of lading in the transaction.\\nThe first respondent denied that the appellant was only a char terer and not liable for the shortage.\\nIt also denied that only English Courts had jurisdiction in the matter.\\nMr. R.F. Nariman the learned counsel for the appellant first submits that the appellant is an English company registered in England carrying on business in England, and it does not carry on any business in India.\\nIt is submitted, as the carrier under clause 3 of the bill of lading, only the appellant has an option either to sue or be sued in England, or in Cochin, which is a port of destination but the shipper 890 had no option to sue at Cochin.\\nIn its written statement it was clearly stated that it had appeared under protest and without prejudice to the contention regarding jurisdiction which contention it had also pressed at the time of the argument, and, therefore, it could not be said to have submitted to the jurisdiction of Cochin court; and it never made any submission or raised any objection as to the fact of short landing.\\nAccording to counsel the High Court has held clause 3 of the bill of lading to be bad on two errone ous grounds, namely, that it offends section 28 of the Contract Act and that it gives an unfair advantage to the carrier which advantage is not given to the consignee.\\nSection 28, according to counsel, is not applicable and clause 3 was not bad on the ground of having given an unfair advantage to the carrier in giving him the option to sue or be sued either in England or at the port of destination and that even if it was bad, only the offending portion could be struck off, the rest of the clause would still be applicable and only the English court would have jurisdiction.\\nRecords show that in the written statement the appellant as defendant in para B stated that the contract evidenced by the bills of lading was governed by English law and the parties had agreed that the disputes were to be determined in England according to English law to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the courts of any other country and that the institution of the suit at Cochin was in violation of that agreement, and hence the Court had no jurisdiction to try the suit and the plaint should be returned for presentation to proper court.\\nIn the Replication filed by the plaintiff it was said: \"The objection regarding jurisdiction raised in clause B of written statement is not tenable.\\nThe cause of action for the suit has arisen within the local limits of the jurisdic tion of this Court.\\nThe defendant is also residing and carrying on business within this court \\'s jurisdiction.\\nIt is now well settled that the parties cannot be consent confer or oust the jurisdiction of a Court.\\nThe plaintiffs deny the agreement mentioned in clause B and no agreement can oust the jurisdiction of the Court when the Court possesses the jurisdiction.\\n\" Issue No. 1 was: \"Whether the suit is properly filed in this Court?\" The trial court in its judgment dated 29.3.\\n1968 held: \"This issue has been considered by this Court on 28.2.\\n1966 891 and it has been found that this Court has jurisdiction to try the suit.\\nThe said finding has been confirmed by the Hon \\'ble High Court on 6.4.1967 in C.R.P. 977/66.\\n\" That judgment is not before us.\\nIn the memo of appeal to the High Court apart from the general grounds that the judgment and decree of the Court below were wrong in law and fact; that the Court below should have held that the suit was not maintainable in law and should have finally dismissed the suit as the owners of the vessel \\'Steliosm \\' a necessary party, as he alone was liable, was not impleaded and pro ceeded against, no specific ground about jurisdiction was taken and consequently we do not find any direct discussion on the point in the High Court judgments.\\nEven so, this being a question of jurisdiction going to the root of the matter we allowed the appellant to make his submissions.\\nThe appellant \\'s submission that the courts at Cochin had no jurisdiction is based on clause 3 of the Bills of Lading which reads as follows: \"3.\\nJURISDICTION: The contract evidence by this bill of lading shall be governed by English law and disputes deter mined in England or, at the option of the Carrier, at the port of destination according to English law to the exclu sion of the jurisdiction of the Courts of any other country.\\n\" If the above clause was binding on the first respondent, without anything more, there could be no doubt that the suit claim arising out of the contract of affreightment evidenced by the bills of lading will have to be determined in England or, at the option of the carrier, that is the appellant, at the port of destination, that is, Cochin, to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the courts of any other country.\\nIs the first respondent bound by this clause of the Bill of Lading? Clause 29 of both the bills of lading Exhibit P 1 and P2 runs as follows: \"Finally in Accepting This Bill of lading.\\nThe shipper, Consignee, and Owner of the goods, and the Holders of this Bill of Lading, expressly accept and agree to all its stipu lations, exceptions, and conditions whether written, print ed, stamped or incorporated, as fully as if they were all signed by such Shipper, Consignee, Owner or Holder.\\n\" 892 The first respondent is the consignee and holder of the bills of lading and ex facie should be bound by this clause.\\nNo doubt the bills of lading were issued to the shipper from whom it was received by the first respondent.\\nThere is no evidence to show that the shipper has repudiated the stipu lations in the bills of lading in any manner.\\nUnder these circumstances would it be open to the first respondent to repudiate clause 3 of the bills of lading? It is a settled principle of Private International Law governing bills of lading that the consignee or an endorsee thereof derives the same rights and title in respect of the goods covered by the bill of lading as the shipper thereof had.\\nFor the purpose of jurisdiction the action of the first respondent is an action in personam in Private International Law.\\nAn action in personam is an action brought against a person to compel him to do a particular thing.\\nIf clause 3 of the bills of lading is held to be binding on the first respondent the choice of law by the parties would also be binding.\\nEnglish courts would perhaps use their own Private International Law to decide the dispute.\\nIn the event of the English Court alone having the jurisdiction, the application of Indian statutes and the jurisdiction of the Indian courts would be, to that extent, inapplicable.\\nUntil the Bills of Lading Act, 1855 was passed in Eng land the endorsement of a Bill of Lading would not affect the contract evidenced in it, and the endorsee could not sue or be sued on such contract, though he was the person really interested in goods, the subject of the contract.\\nBy section 1 of the Bills of Lading Act, 1855, in England \"every con signee of goods named in a Bill of Lading, and every endor see of a Bill of Lading to whom the property of goods shall pass, upon or by reason of such consignment or endorsement shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit and be subject to the same liabilities in respect of such goods as if the contract contained in the Bills of Lading had been made with himself.\" In Sewell vs Burdick, (85, 104) it is held that section 1 is to be given effect in any proceeding in the English Court regardless of the proper law governing the transfer of the bill of lading.\\nThe property passes by reason of consignment or endorsement and the right to sue passes with it.\\nThe consignee or endorsee may lose his right or liability under the Act by such further endorsement of the bill of lading as divests him of the property.\\nSuch a vesting of rights and liabilities on endorsement of a bill of lading does not in any way affect the shipowners \\' rights against the original shippers or owners of the goods for the freight or the shipper \\'s rights under the bill of fading or the liability 893 Of the consignee or indorsee by reason of his being such consignee or indorsee or of his receiving the goods in consequence of such consignment or endorsement, or any right of stoppage in transit.\\nThe Indian Bill of Lading Act, 1856 was based on the English Bills of Lading Act, 1855 (18 and 19 Vict. C. 111) (Act IX of 1856).\\nUnder section 1 of the also every consignee of goods named in a bill of lading and every endorsee of a bill of lading to whom the property in goods therein mentioned shall pass, upon or by reason of such consignment or endorsement, shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit, and be subject to the same liabilities in respect of such goods as if the contract contained in the bill of lading had been made with himself.\\nThe bill of lading is the symbol of the goods, and the right to possess those passes to the transferee of the bill of lading.\\nIn other words, its transfer is symbolic of the transfer of the goods themselves and until the goods have been delivered, the delivery of the duly endorsed bill of lading operates as between the transferor or transferee, and all who claim through them, as a physical delivery of the goods would do.\\nThe bill of lading is a negotiable instru ment in the sense of carrying with it the right to demand and have possession of the goods described in it.\\nIt also carries with it the rights and liabilities under the con tract, where the property in the goods also is transferred.\\nHowever, a bill of lading is not a negotiable instrument in the strict sense of the transferee deriving better title than the transferor.\\nThe transferee of a bill of lading gets no better title than the transferor himself had.\\nMere pos session of the bill of lading does not enable the holder to sue a person at a place where the tranferor himself could not have done.\\nWhere the negotiation of a bill of lading is by the person who had a right to sue on it, mere possession of it does not enable the holder to sue any person who was not liable under it and not to sue another who was liable under it to make good the claim.\\nHe cannot also sue at a place not intended by the parties when intention has been expressed.\\nIt would also be relevant to consider whether English courts would be likely to entertain the instant suit if instituted in England in terms of the bills of lading so that the first respondent is not likely to be without a remedy.\\nDicey & Morris in the Conflict of Laws 1 1th Ed.\\nhave given the following general principles as to jurisdiction in actions in personam: 894 \"Rule 28, Sub rule 4: The court may assume jurisdiction if, in the action begun by the writ, the claim is brought to enforce, rescind, dissolve, annul or otherwise affect a contract, or to recover damages or obtain other relief in respect of the breach of a contract, being (in either case) a contract which (i) was made in England, or (ii) was made by or through an agent trading or residing in England on behalf of a principal trading or residing out of England, or (iii) is by its terms or by implication governed by English law, or (iv) contains a term to the effect that the court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any action in respect of the contract.\\n\" Rule 34 deals with jurisdiction clauses and it says: \"(1) Where a contract provides that all disputes between the parties are to be referred to the jurisdiction of the Eng lish courts, the court normally has jurisdiction to hear and determine any action in respect thereof.\\n(2) Subject to clause (3) of this Rule, where a contract provides that all disputes between the parties are to be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of a foreign tribu nal, the English court will stay proceedings (or, as the case may be, refuse to give leave to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction) instituted in England in breach of such agreement, unless the plaintiff proves that it is just and proper to allow them to continue.\\n(3) Where the case falls within the scope of the 1968 Con vention, unless the defendant submits to the jurisdiction, the court has no jurisdiction to determine a dispute.\\n(a) if one or more of the parties is domiciled in a Con tracting State and the parties have agreed in accordance with Article 17 of the 1968 Convention 895 that the courts of a Contracting State other than the United Kingdom are to have jurisdiction to settle any such dispute; or (b) if none of the parties is domiciled in a Contracting State and the parties have agreed in accordance with Article 17 of the 1968 Convention that the courts of a Contracting State other than the United Kingdom are to have jurisdiction to settle any such dispute and the courts chosen have not declined jurisdiction.\" According to the authors the parties to a contract in international trade or commerce may agree in advance on the forum which is to have jurisdiction to determine disputes which may arise between them.\\nThe chosen court may be a court in the country of one or both the parties, or it may be a neutral forum.\\nThe jurisdiction clause may provide for a submission to the courts of a particular country, or to a court identified by a formula in a printed standard form, such as a bill of lading referring disputes to the courts of the carrier \\'s principal place of business.\\nIt is a question of interpretation, governed by the proper law of the con tract, whether a jurisdiction clause is exclusive or non exclusive, or whether the claim which is the subject matter of the action fails within its terms.\\nIf there is no express choice of the proper law of the con.tract, the law of the country of the chosen court will usually, but not invaria bly, be the proper law.\\nIt is accordingly unlikely that the first respondent would be without any remedy if the terms of clause 3 of the bills of lading are faithfully observed.\\nThe question of jurisdiction in this case ought not ,to be determined by the High Court on the basis of the provi sions of section 28 of the Indian Contract Act in the absence of a specific provision making it applicable to transactions in international trade.\\nThe effective operation of statutes of a country in relation to foreigners and foreign property, including ships, is subject to limitations.\\nIn general, a statute extends territorially, unless the contrary is stat ed, throughout the country and will extend to the territori al waters, and such places as intention to that effect is shown.\\nA statute extends to all persons within the country if that intention is shown.\\nThe Indian Parliament therefore has no authority to legislate for foreign vessels or for eigners in them on the high seas.\\nThus a foreign ship on the high seas, or her foreign owners or their agents in a for eign country, are not deprived of 896 rights by our statutory enactment expressed in general terms unless it provides that a foreign ship entering an Indian port or territorial waters and thus coming within the terri torial jurisdiction is to be covered.\\nIf the Parliament legislates in terms which extend to foreign ships or for eigners beyond the territorial limits of its jurisdiction, the Indian court is of course bound to give effect to such enactment.\\nHowever, no such provision has been referred to in the impugned judgments.\\nWithout anything more Indian statutes are ineffective against foreign property and for eigners outside the jurisdiction.\\nThe Privy Council in Sirdar Gurdyal Singh vs Rajah of Faridkote, (684) decided that no territorial legislation can give jurisdiction in personal action which any foreign court should recognize against absent foreigners owing no allegiance or obedience .to the power which so legislates.\\nLore Selborne said: \"In a personal action to which none of these causes of jurisdiction apply, a decree pronounced in absentem by a foreign court, to the jurisdic tion of which the defendant has not in any way submitted himself, is by international law an absolute nullity.\\nHe is under no obligation of any kind to obey it; and it must be regarded as a mere nullity by the courts of every nation except (when authorised by special local legislation) in the country of the forum by which it was pronounced.\\n\" There may however be submission to the .jurisdiction of an Indian court by litigating in India.\\nThe question then is what would amount to submission to jurisdiction.\\nCheshire & North \\'s Private International Law 11th Ed., on submission to jurisdiction says: \"Despite the fundamental principle that the court cannot entertain an action against a defendant who is absent from England, it has long been recognised that an absent defendant may confer jurisdiction on the court by submitting to it.\\nThis may be done in a variety of ways, such as by the defendant acknowledging service before actual service of the writ, or instructing a solicitor to accept service on his behalf; Commencing an action as a plaintiff will give the court jurisdiction over a counter claim.\\nAlthough a defendant who appears and con tests the case on its merits will be held to have submitted to the jurisdiction, an appearance merely to protest that the court does not have jurisdiction will not constitute submission, even if I the defendant also seeks a stay of proceedings pending the outcome of proceedings abroad.\\n\" The authors go on to say that any person may contract, either expressly or impliedly, to submit to the jurisdiction of a court to which he would not otherwise be subject.\\nIn case of an international contract it is common practice for the par ties, to agree that 897 any dispute arising between them shall be settled by the courts of another country even though both the parties are not resident of that country.\\nIn such a case having consent ed to the jurisdiction one cannot afterwards contest the binding effect of the judgment.\\nThe defendant out of the jurisdiction of the country may be deemed to have been served by service on his agent within the jurisdiction.\\nHowever, parties cannot by submission confer jurisdiction on the court to entertain proceedings beyond its authority.\\nThe jurisdiction of the court may be decided upon by the parties themselves on basis of various connecting factors.\\nWastlake says in his Treatise on Private International Law, at page 5: \"The principal grounds for selecting a particular national jurisdiction in which to bring an action are that the subject of the action, if a thing, is situate, if a contract, was made, or was to be performed, if a de lict, was committed, within the territory: hence the forum situs, or rei sitae, contractus, delicti, the two latter of which are classed together as the forum special obligatio nis.\\nOr that the jurisdiction is that in which all the claims relating to a certain thing or group of things ought to be adjudicated on together, the forum concursus, or that to which the defendant is personally subject, the forum rei.\\n\" In the instant case the appellant submits that as de fendant it appeared before the Indian court to protest its jurisdiction and put forth its defences subject to that protest.\\nThe appellant, it has been stated in para 2 of the judgment under appeal, dated 30.4.1973, had not filed any objection to the findings as to damages.\\nDid it then amount to submitting to the jurisdiction of the Indian court in which the shipper or the first respondent had no right to sue? In Williams & Glyn \\'s Bank PLC vs Astro Dinamico Compania Naviera S.A. & Anr., The Weekly Law Reports Vol.\\n(1) 1984 438, where the plaintiff bank sought to enforce its securi ties against the defendants by instituting proceedings in England in reliance of clause 7 of the guarantees, whereby each of the defendants were expressed to submit irrevocably to the jurisdiction of the English courts.\\nThe respondents (defendants) made an application disputing the jurisdiction of the English courts and had also simultaneously applied for stay of the action.\\nIt was contended on behalf of the appellants (plaintiffs) that the respondents (defendants) either had waived any objection to the jurisdiction because they had taken a step in the action by applying for a stay or that they would waive any objection if they persisted with 898 their application in priority to disputing the jurisdiction.\\nLord Fraser observed that it would surely be quite unrealis tic to say that the respondents had waived their objection to the jurisdiction by applying for a stay as an alternative in the very summons in which they applied for an order giving effect to their objection to the jurisdiction.\\nThat the summons made it abundantly clear that they were object ing and the fact that they asked for a decision upon their objection to be postponed until the outcome of the Greek proceedings was known, was not in any way inconsistent with maintaining their objection.\\nThere was no reason in princi ple or in common sense why the respondents should not be entitled to say: \"We object to the jurisdiction of the English courts, but we ask for the proceedings necessary to decide that and the other issues to be stayed pending the decision of the proceedings in Greece.\\n\" Reference was made to Rein vs Stein, , where it was said at page 471: \"It seems to me that, in order to establish a waiver, you must show that the party alleged to have waived his objection has taken some step which is only necessary or only useful if the objection has been actually waived, or if the objection has never been entertained at all.\" In Dulles \\' Settlement (No.2) ( ; the question was whether a father, who was an American resident outside England, had submitted to the jurisdiction of the English courts in a dispute about payment of maintenance to his child in Eng land.\\nHe had been represented by counsel in the English court, who argued that he was not subject to their jurisdic tion.\\nDenning LJ (as he then was) said at page 850: \"I cannot see how anyone can fairly say that a man has voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of a court, when he has all the time been vigorously protesting that it has no jurisdiction.\\nIf he does nothing and lets judgment go against him in default of appearance, he clearly does not submit to the jurisdiction.\\nWhat difference in principle does it make, if he does not merely do nothing, but actually goes to the court and protests that it has no jurisdiction? I can see no distinction at all.\\n\" The judgment of the court of appeal which held that the application for a stay involved assumption that the court had jurisdiction to entertain the action and therefore the question of jurisdiction must be decided first, was set aside in appeal, and the appeal therefrom was dismissed by the House of Lords.\\nIn the instant case the question is of initial jurisdiction on the 899 basis of claues 3 of the bills of lading.\\nWe have to ask the question whether the shipper could or could not have the right to sue at Cochin under the bills of lading.\\nIf he could not have done so, the appellant \\'s appearance to pro test about jurisdiction would not cure that defect of juris diction.\\nHowever, we find that in the Memo.\\nof appeal before the lower appellate court no specific ground as to jurisdic tion was taken through there were grounds on non maintain ability of the suit.\\nEven in the Special Leave Petition before this Court no ground of lack of jurisdiction of the courts below has been taken.\\nWe are, therefore, of the view that the appellant has to be held to have either waived the objection as to jurisdiction or to have submitted to the jurisdiction in the facts and circumstances of the case.\\nThe defence that the suit was not maintainable in the absence of the owner of the ship could in a sense be said to have been on the merits of the case.\\nThe submission as to lack of jurisdiction is, therefore, rejected.\\nClause 3 of the bills of lading also contains the selec tion of law made by the parties.\\nThe contract is governed by English law and disputes are to be determined according to English Law.\\nIs the selection of law binding? In Cheshire & North \\'s Private International Law 1 th Ed., page 495,, while discussing about the interpretation of contracts the authors say: \"When the stage has been reached where an obligation, formally and essentially valid and binding on parties of full capacity, has been created, then in the further matters that may require the intervention of the Court, there is, speaking generally, no reason in principle why the parties should not be free to select the governing law.\\n\" The express choice of law made by parties obviates need for interpretation.\\nIn the absence of an express choice the question of the proper law of contract would arise.\\nThe parties to a con tract should be bound by the jurisdiction clause to which they have agreed unless there is some strong reason to the contrary.\\nDicey & Morris in the Conflict of Laws formulate the following rule on proper law of contract as Rule 180: \"The term \"Proper law of a contract\" means the system of law by which the parties intended the contract to be governed, or, where their intention is neither expressed nor to be inferred from the circumstances, the system of law with which the transaction has its closest and most real connec tion.\" 900 Sub rule 1: \"When the intention of the parties to a contract, as to the law governing the contract, is expressed in words, this expressed intention, in general, determines the proper law of the contract.\\n\" Sub rule 2: \"When the intention of the parties to a contract with regard to the law governing the contract is not expressed in words, their intention is to be inferred from the terms and nature of the contract, and from the general circumstances of the case, and such inferred intention determines the proper law of the contract .\\n\" There can, therefore, be no doubt that the instant contract of affreightment evidenced by the bills of lading will be governed by English law.\\nAs the law has been chosen, the proper law will be the domestic law of England and the proper law must be the law at the time when the contract is made throughout the life of the contract and there cannot be a \"floating\" proper law.\\nIt has been recognised since Gienar vs Meyer, [1796] 2 Hy B 1608, that the the time of making the contract the parties may expressly select the law by which it is to be governed and they may declare their common intention by a simple statement that the contract shall be governed by the .law of a particular country.\\nThis has been settled by a long line of decisions, as \\'Rex vs Internation al Trustee for the Protection of Bondholders AG, (529); Vita Food Products Inc. vs Unus Shipping Co. Ltd., (289 90); James Miller and Partners Ltd. vs Whitworth Street Estates (Manchester) Ltd., (603); Mackender vs Feldia AG, ; Com pagnie d \\' Armement Maritime SA vs Compagnie Tunisienne de Navigation SA, and Acrow (Automation) Ltd. vs Rex Chainbelt Inc., [1971] 3 All E.R. 1175.\\nIt is true that in English law there are certain limita tions on freedom to choose the governing law.\\nThe choice must be bona fide and legal, and not against public policy.\\nIt may not be permissible to choose a wholly unconnected law which is not otherwise a proper law of contract.\\nEnglish courts, it has been said, should, and do, have a residual power to strike down for good reasons, choice of law clauses, totally unconnected with the contract.\\nWhere there is no express 901 choice of the proper law, it is open to Court to determine whether there is an implied or inferred choice of law in the parties contract.\\nThe next question to be decided is whether the appellant would be liable for the suit claim.\\nThis would naturally depend on the contract of affreightment.\\nIt is an accepted principle that the bill of lading is not the contract of affreightment, for that has been made before the bill of lading was signed and delivered, but it evidences the terms of that contract.\\nThe bill of lading serves as a receipt and also as a document of tittle and may be transferred by endorsement and delivery.\\nArticle III(3) of the Hague Rules says that a bill of lading is prima facie evidence of the receipt by the carrier of the goods described therein.\\nThe Hamburg Rules define a bill of lading under Article 1(7) as follows: \"Bill of lading\" means a document which evidences a contract of carriage by sea and the taking over or loading of the goods by the carrier, and by which the carrier undertakes to deliver the goods against surrender of the document.\\nA provision in the document that the goods are to be delivered to the order of a named person, or to order, or to bearer, constitutes such an undertaking.\\n\" The Hague Rules say that after the goods are taken into his charge, the carrier or his agent shall issue to the shipper, if he so demands, a bill of lading, showing among other things the particulars of the goods.\\nThe contract of affreightment need not necessarily be expressed in writing.\\nThe bill of lading is evidence of the terms of the contract which can also be ascertained from the charterparty where one exists.\\nDr. Justice T. Kochu Thommen in his book of Bills of Lading in International Law and Practice at page 25 writes: \"As between the shipowner and the shipper, the bill of lading is not conclusive evidence of the terms of the con tract and parties to the contract are entitled to prove that the stipulations in the bill of lading are at variance with the agreed terms of the contract, as expressed or evidenced in other documents.\\nIn practice, however, the terms of the bill of lading govern the contractual relations between the shipowner and the shipper, and the booking note generally states that the carrier \\'s regular forms of bill of lading shall 902 be used and all the terms thereof shall form part of the contract.\\nThe bill of lading assumes the character of con clusive evidence once it has passed into the hands of a consignee or indorsee and evidence may not be given which varies or contradicts it.\\nThe position is, however, differ ent when the ship is under charter and stipulations in the charterparty are expressly and clearly incorporated in the bill of lading.\\nIn such a case the bill of lading, even after it has passed in to the hands of a consignee or indor see, has to be read subject to the charterparty stipula tions.\\nIn the hands of a charterer, the bill of lading is only a receipt and the charterparty is the governing docu ment as far as the shipowner \\' and the charterer are con cerned.\\n\" Apart from the question of the charterparty having been proved or not according to law the question in the instant case is whether clause 4 of the charterparty as to responsi bility of the shipowner in respect of the goods carried would form part of or be incorporated in the bills of lad ing.\\nHow far the charterparty clauses laying down the re sponsibility and liabilities between the charterer and the shipowner can be attributed to the consignee under the bill of lading? It is an accepted principle that if certain clauses of the charterparty are referred to in the bill of lading those should be referred to in specific terms so as to bind the shipper and the consignee.\\nA general reference may not be sufficient under all circumstances.\\nThus in T.W. Thomas & Co. Ltd. vs Portsea Steamship Co. Ltd., in the bill of lading there was also a marginal clause in writing as follows: \"Deck load at shipper \\'s risk, and all other terms and condi tions and exceptions of charter to be as per charterparty, including negligence clause.\\n\" The question was whether the arbitration clause in the charter~ party was incorporated by the reference in the bill of lading.\\nLord Loreburn L.C. answering this question wheth er an arbitration clause found in the charterparty was applicable to the contract evidenced by the bill of lading, and to disputes arising between the shipowners and the holders of the bill of lading under that document, replied in the negative.\\nLord Atkinson observed that when it was sought to introduce into a document like a bill of lading a negotiable instrument a clause such as the arbitration clause, not germane to the receipt, carriage, or delivery of the cargo or the payment of freight, the proper subject matters with which the bill of lading is conversant, that should 903 be done by distinct and specific words, and not by such general words as those written in the margin of the bill of lading in that case.\\nIn Vita Food Products, Incorporated vs Unus Shipping Co. Ltd., , the bill of lading set out in detail the terms and conditions of the contract \"which are hereby mutually agreed upon as follows\".\\nClause 7 contained a general exemption in respect of the goods carried from liability for all damage capable of being covered by insur ance and from liability above a certain value per package unless a special declaration was made.\\nThe same clause also provided that \"these contracts have been governed by English Law.\" While determining what was the proper law of the contract the Privy Council held that the expressed words of the bill of lading must receive effect with the result that the contract was governed by English Law.\\nIt was said: \"It is now well settled that by English Law (and the law of Nova Scotia is the same) the proper law of the contract is the law which the parties intended to apply.\\nThat intention is objectively ascertained, and, if not expressed, will be presumed from the terms of the contract and the relevant surrounding circumstances.\\n\" In that case the goods were shipped in Newfoundland under bills of lading which did not contain the statement required by section 3 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1932 which incorporated the Hague rules subject to certain modifications but the bill of lading contained a general clause that the contracts \"shall be governed by English Law\" and applying that law the Shipowner was held to be within the exceptions which exempted him from liability.\\nIn Rex vs\\nInternational Trustee for the protection of Bondholders, , it was held that the inten tion of the parties would be ascertained from what is ex pressed in the contract, which will be conclusive.\\nRepelling the contention that the transaction which was one relating to the carriage on a Nova Scotian ship of goods from New foundland to New York between residents in those countries, contained nothing to connect it in any way with English law, and that choice could not be seriously taken, their Lord ships held that connection with English law was not as a matter of principle essential.\\nThe , which is based on the Bills of Lading Act of 1855 of England in its preamble says: \"Whereas by the custom of merchants a bill of lading of goods being transferable by endorsement, the property in the goods may thereby pass to the indorsee, but nevertheless all rights in respect of the contract contained in the bill of lading continue in the original shipper or owner, and it is 904 expedient that such rights should pass with the property.\\n\" Section 1 of the Act provides that fights under bills of lading are to vest in consignee or endorsee.\\nIt says: \"Every consignee of goods named in a bill of lading and every endorsee of a bill of lading to whom the property in the goods therein mentioned shall pass, upon or by reason of such consignment or endorsement, shall have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit, and be subject to the same liabilities in respect of such goods as if the contract contained in the bill of lading had been made with himself.\" Thus a bill of lading is intended to provide for the rights and liabilities of the parties arising out of the contract of affreightment.\\nIf the consignee claims the goods under a bill of lading he is bound by its terms.\\nThe property in the cargo passes to the consignee or the endorsee of the bill of lading but the contract whereunder the consignment or en dorsement is made has always to be taken into consideration.\\nThus the consignee or an endorsee gets only such rights as its consignor or endorser had in respect of the goods men tioned in the bill of lading.\\nThis is in conformity with Private International law applicable to the case.\\nThe Indian Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 1925 (Act XXVI of 1925) is an Act to amend the law with respect to carriage of goods by sea.\\nIt was passed after accepting the recommen dations of the International Conference on maritime Law held at Brussels in October, 1922 and accepting the rules con tained in the Draft Convention held at Brussels meeting in October, 1923 amending the rules to give the rules the force of law with a view to establish the responsibilities, li abilities, rights and amenities attaching to carriers on the bills of lading.\\nBut the Rules of the act are not applicable to this case.\\nThe High Court rejected the contention of the appellant that it could not be made personally liable for claim on the grounds that the bills of lading were issued in the printed forms of the appellant company bearing its name at the top and that beyond what appeared at the bottom over the signa ture and seal, there was nothing at all to indicate that the appellant company was issuing the bills of lading for and on behalf of any owners of the vessel.\\nHowever, the conditions printed on the reverse of the bills of lading itself could not have been avoided.\\nClause 4 Agency Clause said: \"If the vessel is not owned by or chartered by demise to the company or Line by whom this bill of lading is issued (as may be the case notwithstanding anything that appears to 905 the contrary) this bill of lading shall take effect only as a contract with the owner or demise chatterers as the case may be as principal made through the agency of the said company or Line who act solely as agents and shall be under no personal liability whatsoever in respect thereon.\" This clause ex facie establishes a privity of contract between the owner or demise charterer of the vessel on the one hand and the shipper to whom the bill of lading has been issued by the appellant company as the charterer otherwise than by demise.\\nThe High Court construed this clause to be one relieving or lessening the carrier \\'s liability without considering whether it was otherwise than as provided in the Rules under the Carriage of Goods Act, 1924 of England.\\nIn Halsbury \\'s Laws of England 4th edn.\\n43, para 401, it is said.\\n\"A contract for the carnage of goods in a ship is called in law a contract of affreightment.\\nIn practice these con tracts are usually written and most frequently are expressed in one or other of two types of document called respectively a charterparty and a bill of lading.\" In para 402 we read that a contract by charterparty is a contract by which an entire ship or some principal part of her is let to a mer chant, called \\'the charterer \\', for the conveyance of goods on a determined voyage to one or more places, or until the expiration of a specified period.\\nIn the first case it is called a \"voyage charterparty\", and in the second a \"time charterparty\".\\nSuch a contract may operate as a demise of the ship herself, to which the services of the master and the crew may or may not be added, or it may confer on the charterer nothing more than the right to have his goods conveyed by a particular ship, and, as subsidiary to it, to have the use of the ship and the services of the master and crew.\\nThus for the purposes of ascertaining the responsibili ty of a charterer in respect of the cargo shipped and land ed, it would be necessary to know not only the stipulations between the shipper i.e. the owner of the cargo and the charterer, evidenced by the bill of lading and also those between the charterer and the owner of the ship.\\nIf the charter is by way of demise the problem would be simple inasmuch as the bill of lading will be purely between the shipper and the charterer.\\nIn cases of a \\'voyage charter \\' or a \\'time charter \\' one has to find out the actual terms of the charter to ascertain whether they operated as charter by demise or made the charterer only as an agent 906 of the shipowner and if so to what extent so as to ascertain the extent of privity established between the shipper, and the shipowner as stipulated in the bill of lading.\\nCharterparties by way of demise, says Halsbury, at para 403, are of two kinds: \"(1) charter without master or crew, or \"bareboat charter\", where the hull is the subject matter of the charterparty and (2) charter with master and crew, under which the ship passes to the charterer in a state fit for the purposes of mercantile adventure.\\nIn both cases the charterer becomes for the time being the owner of the ship; the master and crew are, or become to all intents and pur poses, his employees, and through them the possession of the ship is in him.\\nThe owner, on the other hand, has divested himself of all control either over the ship or over the master and crew, his sole fight being to receive the stipu lated hire and to take back the ship when the charterparty comes to an end.\\nDuring the currency of the charterparty, therefore, the owner is under no liability to third persons whose goods may have been conveyed upon the demised ship or who may have done work or supplied stores for her, and those persons must look only to the charterer who has taken his place.\\n\" In para 404 Halsbury said: \"Although a charterparty which does not operate as a demise confers on the charterer the temporary right to have his goods loaded and conveyed in the ship, the ownership remains in the original owner, and through the master and crew, who continue to be his employees, the possession of the ship also remains in him.\\nTherefore, the existence of the char terparty does not necessarily divest the owner of liability to third persons whose goods may have been conveyed on the ship, nor does it deprive him of his rights as Owners.\\n\" Whether a charterparty operates as a demise or not depends on the stipulations of the charterparty.\\nThe princi pal test is whether the master is the employee of the owner or of the charterer.\\nIn other words where the master becomes

others.\\nWhere the charterparty does not operate as a demise, the charterer \\'s right vis a vis the owner depends upon the terms of the contract.\\n\"The contract of carnage is personal to the 907 charterer, and he cannot call upon the shipowner to under take liabilities to third persons or transfer to third persons his own liabilities to the shipowner unless the contract so provides.\\n\" A charterparty has to be construed so as to give effect, as far as possible, to the intention of the parties as expressed in the written contract.\\nThe stipu lations of charterparty may be incorporated in a bill of lading so that they are thereby binding on the parties.\\nIt is an accepted principle that when stipulations of the charterparty are expressly incorporated, they become terms of the contract contained in the bill of lading, and they can be enforced by or against the shipper, consignee or endorsee.\\nThe effect of a bill of lading depends upon the circumstances of the particular case, of which the most important is the position of the shipper and of the holder.\\nWhere there is a bill of lading relating to the goods, the terms of the contract on which the goods are carried are prima facie to be ascertained from the bill of lading.\\nHowever, if a shipper chose to receive a bill of lading in a certain from without protest he should ordinarily be bound by it.\\nThus, it cannot be said that the bill of lading is not conclusive evidence of its terms and the person execut ing it is not necessarily bound by all its stipulations, unless he repudiates them on the ground that, as he did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to know, of their existence, his assent to them is not to be inferred from his acceptance of the bill of lading without objection.\\nWhere there is a charterparty, the bill of lading is prima facie, as between the shipowner and an indorsee, the contract on which the goods are carried.\\nThis is so when the indorsee is ignorant of the terms of the charterparty, and may be so even if he knows of them.\\nAs between the shipowner and the charterer the bill of lading may in some cases have the effect of modifying the contract as contained in the char terparty, although, in general, the charterparty will pre vail and the bill of lading will operate solely as an ac knowledgement of receipt.\\nIn the instant case we find from Exts.\\nP 1 to P3 that the following has been prominently printed just below the signature \\'For the Master and Owners \\' in the bills of lad ing.\\nSEE CONDITIONS OF CARRIAGE AND OTHER

there being no other conditions printed elsewhere in the bills of lading.\\nNone of the parties having repudiated the bills of lading in this case, the High Court ought not to have ac cepted the submission of .the first respondent that clause 4 of the bills of lading offended the provisions of the Car riage of Goods by Sea Act, 1924 and therefore bad.\\n908 The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, of 1924 of England was on the Hague Rules which were amended by Brussels protocol 1968 which is now embodied in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 which came into force in 1977.\\nThe Indian Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1925 (Act XXVI of 1925) which is an Act to amend the law with respect to the carriage of goods by sea was passed after the International Conference on Maritime Law held at Brussels in October 1922 and Brussels meeting in October 1923.\\nUnder Section 2 of that Act which deals with application of rules it is provided: \"Subject to the provi sions of this Act, the rules set out in the Schedule (here inafter referred to as \"the Rules\") shall have the effect in relation to and in connection with the carriage of goods by sea in ships carrying goods from any port in India to any other port whether in or outside India.\" To apply the Rules to a case, the port of origin has to be an Indian Port.\\nUnless the starting point or the port of loading is a port in India the Rules are inapplicable.\\nThese Rules have no application when goods are not carried from any Indian port.\\nAs in the instant case goods were shipped in Africa and carried to Cochin, this Act obviously was not applicable.\\nThere is nothing to show that the charterparty was by way of demise.\\nPacta dant legem contractui the stipulations of parties constitute the law of the

Ramakrishnan Kulwant Rai, the respondent firm, owned the Steel Rolling Mill, located at No. 4 B, 4 C, North Railway 447 Terminus Road, Royapuram, Madras 13.\\nThe said Mill was leased out to a partnership firm known as M/s. Steel Indus tries.\\nAfter termination of the lease the respondent firm took back possession of the said Mill on 1 8 1962 and in formed the Central Excise Authorities about this by their letter dated 16 11 1962 and resumed manufacture of Steel from scraps and was advised to take out a licence for which it applied on 30 11 1962.\\nThough the respondent firm had ultimately sold away the Rolling Mill on 8 4 1963, the Superintendent of Central Excise, by his letter dated 13 10 1965 demanded a sum of Rs. 31,0 18.2013 as excise duty.\\nOn information furnished by the firm about its manu facture of only 775.455 metric tonnes of Steel, the Deputy Superintendent of Central Excise reduced the demand to a sum of Rs. 6,4 19.38p only, and the demand was reiterated by notice dated 13 4 1967, pursuant whereto the respondent firm showed cause on 15th May, 1967 but the Assistant Collector of Customs, by his order dated 14th June, 1967, confirmed the demand.\\nThe respondent firm challenged the demand by moving writ petition No. 1864 of 1967 in the High Court of Judicature at Madras contending, inter alia, that it was manufacturing steel products prior to 13 6 1962, only suspending manufac ture during the period of lease and resuming thereafter, and as such, was entitled to exemption from payment of duty; that the demand for payment of duty was time barred; that rules 10 & 10A invoked in support of the demand were ultra vires inasmuch as there was no provision in the Act to enable the Government to frame rules for the recovery of duty short levied.\\nThe High Court by the impugned order following its earlier judgment in writ petition Nos. 265 & 266 of 1967, which relied upon its earlier decision in writ petition No. 1055 of 1968, upheld the contention of the respondent firm holding that Rule 10 A did not apply to cases where there had been no prior levy of excise duty in respect of the articles manufactured during the relevant period and that the duty was sought to be recovered only by the issue of demand under Rule 10 A of the Rules.\\nThe High Court having rejected leave to appeal, the.\\nappellant obtained special leave on 23 7 1974.\\nMr. Anil Dev Singh, learned counsel for the appellant submits that it is necessary to decide the substantial question of law of general importance, namely, whether Rule 10 A of the Rules, as it stood at the relevant time, was valid or not as conflicting decisions have been creating difficulties for the department in collecting short levies or escaped excise duties.\\nCounsel refers us to , AIR 1972 S.C. 448 2563, and The learned counsel states that Rule 10 A was in force upto 6 8 1977 whereafter it was amended with effect from that date and the amended rule continued till 16 11 1980 where after it was enacted as Section 11 A of the Act by the Amendment Act 25 of 1978 and that Section came into force with effect from 1.7 11 1980.\\nMr. Ambrish Kumar, the learned counsel for the respond ent submits that the learned standing counsel for the Cen tral Government having conceded that the rationale of the decision in Haji J.A. Kareem Sait vs Dy.\\nCommercial Tax Officer, Mettupalayam, 18 STC .370, which held that sub Rule (7) of Rule 5 of the Central Sales Tax (Madras) Rules 1957, providing for limitation and determination of escaped turn over by best judgment was in excess of the rule making power and the sub Rule as a whole, was therefore, invalid, would apply with equal force to Rule 10 A as well and that in view of the same decision he would not be able to sustain the demands under Rule 10 A and yet he could sustain the demand under Rule 9(2) of the Rules, it is no longer open to the appellant to challenge the validity of Rule 10 A in this appeal, and that too after so many years.\\nCounsel for the appellant answers that the learned standing counsel thereby cannot be said to have conceded that Rule 10 A was invalid.\\nHe had only said that in view of the decision in 18 STC 370, he would not be able to sustain the demands under Rule 10 A; and that even if it could be taken as a concession, the appellant could not be estopped from showing that the rule is valid so that Central Excise revenue is not allowed to escape.\\nWe agree with the learned counsel for the appellant and proceed to examine the validi ty of Rule 10 A as it stood at the relevant time.\\nRule 10 A of the Rules read as under: \"10 A. Residuary powers for recovery of sums due to Government Where these Rules do not make any specific provision for the collection of any duty or any deficiency in duty if the duty has for any reason been short levied, or of any other sum of any kind payable to the Central Government under the Act or these Rules, such duty, deficiency in duty or sum shall, on a written demand made by the proper officer, be paid to such person and at such time and place as the officer may specify.\\n\" Rule 10 A provided the machinery for collection of tax from the assessee after the goods had left the factory premises.\\nThis rule con 449 templated that the duty or deficiency in duty was payable on a written demand made by the proper officer in cases where either the Rules did not make any specific provision for the collection of any duty or of any deficiency in duty if the duty had for any reason been short levied.\\nTherefore, before Rule 10 A could be resorted to, it had to be found that either the Central Excise Rules did not make any specific provision for the collection of duty in respect whereof a demand was being made by the proper officer, or that there was no specific provision therein for the collection of the deficiency in duty which had been short levied for any reason.\\nIt was a residuary provision and it applied only when there was no other specific provision in the Rules.\\nWhere there had been no assessment at all there was no reason why claim and demand of the respondent could not be said to be recoverable under Rule 10 A.\\nThe learned counsel for the appellant submits that this Rule is perfectly valid being covered by the rule making powers under the Act while the learned counsel for the respondent, submits that it is ultra vires the Act being not covered by its rule making powers.\\nThe question, therefore, is whether the Rule is valid.\\nChapter II of the Act deals with levy and collection of duty.\\nUnder Section 3 of the Act duties specified in First Schedule to the Act were to be levied.\\nSub section (1) of Section 3, at the relevant time, read as follows: \"(1) There shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India, and a duty on salt manufactured in, or import ed by land into, any part of India as, and at the rates, set forth in the First Schedule.\\n\" In Citadel Fine Pharmaceuticals vs Dis trict Revenue Officer, Chingleput, , where the enactment, namely, the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act (XVI of 1955) was silent on the question of levies of escaped assessment, it was held that the Rules made under that Act could not extend the charging power and Rule 12, in so far as it sought to extend the charging power under Section 3 of that Act, was held to be invalid and without jurisdic tion.\\nRule 12 of those Rules read as follows: \"12.\\nResiduary powers for recovery of sums due to 450 Government Where these rules do not make any specific provision for the collection of any duty or of any deficiency in duty if the duty has for any reason been short levied, or of any other sum of any kind payable to the collecting Government under the Act or these rules, such duty, deficiency in duty or sum shall on written demand made by the proper officer, be paid to such person and at such time and place, as the proper officer may specify.\\n\" Rule 12 was somewhat similar to RUle 10 A of the Rules and had been held to be ultra vires on the ground that it did not have the required statutory backing.\\nIn M/s. Agarwal Brothers vs The Union of India, , it was held that a licence issued under the Central Excise Rules was personal to the licensee and therefore, a transferee of factory licensed to manufacture iron and steel products from the former licensee could only be treated as a new licensee after the relevant date mentioned in the Notification No. 13 1 of 1962, dated 13th June, 1962, and as the petitioner applied for a licence much later, the exemption under the Notification was not available to the petitioner who could not be applying for renewal of the earlier licence held by the transferors and hence the exemption under the Notifica tion was not available to the petitioner.\\nDemand, therefore, could only be made under Rule 10 A which, it was held, could not be invoked in view of the decisions in W.P. No. 1053/68, namely the Citadel Fine (supra).\\nA Division Bench of Kerala High Court in Kerala Poly thene vs Superintendent, Central Excise, since reported in , held that Rule 10 A of the rules was not ultra vires the rule making power conferred by the Act on the Central Government.\\nBalakrishna Eradi, J., as he then was, observed that the scope of the rule making power con ferred by Section 3(1) of the Act was wide enough to embrace all matters relating to the manner in which both the levy and the collection of duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt were to be made.\\nThe provision con tained in Rule 10 A was thus fully within the scope of the said power and hence it was not correct to say that Rule 10 A was ultra vires the rule making power conferred by the Act on the Central Government.\\nThe cases of Agarwal Brothers (supra) and Citadel Fine Pharmaceuticals (supra) were dis tinguished pointing out that there was much difference in scopes of Section 3 of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act (XVI of 1955) and of Section 3 of the Act.\\nComparing the provisions of the two Sections it was observed that there was funda 451 mental difference in their policy and scheme.\\nUnder Section 3 of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act only the manner of collection of the duties was left to be prescribed by the rules and levy of the duty was to be made at the rates specified in the Schedule to the Act.\\nIn enacting Section 3 of the Act i.e. Central Excise and Salt Act, the Parliament had empowered the rule making authority to pre scribe by rules the manner of levy of duties and also the manner of collection of duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt.\\nManifestly the rule making power conferred by this Section is very much wider in its ambit than the power conferred on the rule making authority under Section 3 of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act whereunder only the manner of collection of duties could be laid down by rules.\\nWe respectfully agree with this view.\\nWe also find that in Agarwal Brothers (supra) though one of the questions raised was the validity of Rule 10 A of the Rules, the Court did not consider the said question on merits in view of the submission made by the standing counsel for the State Government on the basis of Rule 10 A in the light of the earlier decisions of the same High Court, striking down Rule 12 of the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Rules.\\nThat decision can not obviously be regarded as authority supporting the con tention that Rule 10 A was ultra vires the rule making power.\\nWe find that Rule 10 A, was incorporated because of the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Messrs Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel vs Union of India, After that decision the Central Government by a notifica tion, dated December 8, 195 1, amended the Rules by addition of the new Rule 10 A.\\nThe assessee challenged the validity of the Rule but a full bench of the Nagpur High Court re jected the assessee \\'s contention and held that Rule 10 A covered a case for increased levy on the basis of a change of law.\\nThat decision was challenged before this Court unsuccessfully.\\nThis Court in Chhotabhai Jethabhai Patel and Co. vs The Union of India, ; , reject ed the assessee \\'s claim regarding non applicability of Rule 10 A stating that it had been specifically designed for the enforcement of a demand like the one in that case.\\nWe also find that in N.B. Sanjana vs Elphinstone Spin ning and Weaving Mills Company Ltd., [2971] 1 SCC 337, while holding that Rule 10 A did not apply to the facts of that case, this Court observed that Rule 10 A did not apply as the specific provision for collection of duty in a case like that was specially provided for by Rule 10 and, therefore, action should have been taken under that Rule.\\n452 In Assistant Collector vs National Tobacco Co. Ltd., ; , this Court held that the High Court erroneously refused to consider whether the impugned notice in that case fell under Rule 10 A.\\nIt was observed that Rules 10 and 10 A seemed to be so widely worded as to cover any inadvertance, error etc.; whereas Rule 10 A would appear to cover any deficiency in duty if the duty had, for any reason, been short levied, except that it would be outside the purview of Rule 10 A if its collection was expressly provided by any Rule.\\nIt was further observed that both the Rules as they stood at the relevant time dealt with collec tion and not with assessment and what was said in N.B. Sanjana \\'s case (supra) that Rule 10 A was of residual in character and would be inapplicable if a case fell within a specified category of cases mentioned in Rue 10, was reiter ated.\\nIn D.R. Kohli vs Atul Products Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 832, this Court pointed out the differences between the two Rules namely Rule 10 and Rule 10 A as: \"(i) whereas Rule 10 applies to cases of short levy through inadvertence, error, collusion or misconstruction on the part of an officer, or through mis statement as to the quantity, the description or value of the excisable goods on the part of the owner, Rule 10 A was a residuary clause applied to those cases which were not covered by Rule 10 and that; (ii) whereas under Rule 10, the deficit amount could not be collected after the expiry of three months from the date on which the duty or charge was paid or adjusted in owner \\'s account current or from the date of making the refund, Rule 10 A did not con tain any such period of limitation.\\n\" It would thus be clear that this Court interpreted Rule 10 A, distinguished it from Rule 10 and applied it to the appropriate facts and circumstances of different cases.\\nIt would be reasonable to infer that in none of the cases any doubt about the validity of the Rule 10 A was entertained.\\nWe may now examine the contention that at the relevant time Rule 10 A was not covered by the rule making power conferred on the Central Government by Section 37.\\nSection 37 dealt with power of Central Government to make Rules.\\nSub section (1) said: \"The Central Government may make rules to carry into effect the purposes of this Act.\" Sub section (2) enumerated the matters the rules might provide for \\'in particular \\' and \"without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power.\" Thus, the section did not require that the enumerated rules would be exhaustive.\\nAny rule if it could be shown to have been made \"to carry into effect the pur poses of the Act\" would 453 be within the rule making power.\\nChapter II of the Act dealt with the levy and collection of duty.\\nSection 3 as it stood at the relevant time provided that duties specified in the First Schedule were to be levied.\\nWe have quoted Sub section (1).\\nThe First Schedule contained Item Nos.\\ndescription of goods and rates of duty.\\nSection 3 has subsequently been amended by the Finance Acts of 1982 and 1984, and the Cen tral Excise Tariff Act of 1985.\\nThis section, it would be seen, expressly empowered the levy and collection of duties of excise on all excisable goods as provided in the Act including its First Schedule.\\nIt could not, therefore, be said that Rule 10 A was not covered by the above provision.\\nIt is an accepted principle that delegated authority must be exercised strictly within the limits of the authori ty.\\nIf rule making power is conferred and the rules made are in excess of that power the rules would be void even if the Act provided that they shall have effect as though enacted in the Act as was ruled in State of Kerala vs K.M. Charia Abdullah & Co., ; Therein the High Court having declared rule 14 A of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules, 1939 as ultra vires, on appeal, this Court by majori ty held that the validity of the rule, even though it was directed to have effect as if enacted in the Act, was always open to challenge on the ground that it was unauthorised.\\nThe validity of the delegated legislation is generally a question of vires, that is, whether or not the enabling power has been exceeded or otherwise wrongfully exercised.\\nScrutinising the provisions of Rule 10 A in the light of the above principles and pronouncements of this Court, we have no doubt that Rule 10 A of the Rules, as it existed at the relevant time, was valid and not ultra vires the rule making power.\\nDemand notices lawfully issued under the rule by the competent authority could not, therefore, be challenged on the ground of the rule 10 A itself being ultra vires.\\nWheth er those could be challenged on any other ground must neces sarily depend on the facts and circumstances of the case.\\nThe High Court having proceeded on the basis that Rule 10 A was not available to support the demand notice, we set aside the impugned order of the High Court, allow the ap peal, and remand the case to the High Court for disposal in accordance with law.\\nWe leave the other questions open.\\nUnder the peculiar facts and circumstance of the case, we leave the parties to bear their own costs.\\nY.

procedure which keeps large number of people behind bars without trial for long, cannot possibly be regarded as \"reasonable, just or fair\" so as to be in conformity with the requirement of article 21.\\nIt is necessary, therefore, that the law as enacted by the Legislature and as administered by the courts must radically change its approach to pre trial detention and ensure `reasonable, just and fair \\' procedure which has a creative connotation after the decision of the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi \\'s case.\\n[174 C D] 2.\\nSpeedy trial is of the essence of criminal justice and, therefore, delay in trial by itself constitutes denial of justice.\\nThough speedy trial is not specifically enumerated as a fundamental right, it is implicit in the broad sweep and content of article 21.\\nSpeedy trial which means reasonably expeditious trial, is an integral part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in article 21, [179 H, 180 C, F] article 21 confers fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and it is not enough to constitute compliance with the requirement of that Article that some semblance of a procedure should be prescribed by law, but that the procedure should be \"reasonable, fair and just\".\\nIf a person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure which is not \"reasonable, fair or just\", such deprivation would be violative of his fundamental right under article 21 and he would be entitled to enforce such fundamental right and secure his release.\\nAny procedure prescribed by law for depriving a person of his liberty cannot be \"reasonable, fair or just\" unless that procedure ensures a speedy trial for determination of the guilt of such person.\\n[180 D E] 170 Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India, [1978] 2 SCR 621; referred to.\\nExpeditious trial and freedom from detention are part of human rights and basic freedoms.\\nThe judicial system which permits incarceration of men and women for long periods of time without trial is denying human rights to such undertrials and withholding basic freedoms from them.\\nLaw has become for them an instrument of injustice and they are helpless and despairing victims of the callousness of the legal and judicial system.\\n[173 C E, F] 4.\\nOne reason why our legal and judicial system continually denies justice to the poor by keeping them for long years in pretrial detention is the highly unsatisfactory bail system, which suffers from a property oriented approach.\\nIt proceeds on the erroneous assumption that risk of monetary loss is the only deterrent against fleeing from justice.\\nEven after its re enactment, the Code of Criminal Procedure continues to adopt the same antiquated approach.\\nWhere an accused is to be released on his personal bond, it insists that the bond should contain a monetary obligation requiring the accused to pay a sum of money in case he fails to appear at the trial.\\nMoreover, as if this were not sufficient deterrent to the poor, the courts mechanically and as a matter of course insist that the accused should produce sureties who will stand bail for him and these sureties must again establish their solvency to be able to pay the amount of bail in case the accused fails to appear to answer the charge.\\n[174 E G] This system of bails operates very harshly against the poor and it is only the non poor who are able to take advantage of it by getting themselves released on bail.\\nThe poor find it difficult to furnish bail even without sureties because very often the amount of the bail fixed by the Court is so unrealistically excessive that in a majority of cases the poor are unable to satisfy the police or the Magistrate about their solvency for the amount of the bail and where the bail is with sureties, as is usually the case, it becomes an almost impossible task for the poor to find persons sufficiently solvent to stand as sureties.\\nThe result is that either they are fleeced by the police and revenue officials or by touts and professional sureties and sometimes they have even to incur debts for securing their release or, being unable to obtain release, they have to remain in jail until such time as the court is able to take up their cases for trial, leading to grave consequences, namely, (1) though presumed innocent, they are subjected to psychological and physical deprivations of jail life, (2) they are prevented from contributing to the preparation of their defence and (3) they lose their job, if they have one, and are deprived of an opportunity to work to support themselves and their family members with the result that the burden of their detention almost invariably falls heavily on the innocent members of the family.\\n[174 G 175 D] The bail system, as it operates today, is thus a source of great hardship to the poor and if the civil effects of poverty are to be eliminated and a fair and just treatment assured to the poor in the administration of justice, it is imperative that the bail system should be thoroughly reformed so that it should be possible for the poor, as easily as the rich, to obtain pre trial release without jeopardizing the interest of justice.\\n[177 C D] Risk of monetary loss is not the only deterrent against fleeing from justice.\\nThere are also other factors which act as equal deterrents against fleeing.\\nTherefore, the courts, even under the law as it stands today, must abandon the antiquated concept under which pre trial release is ordered only against bail with sureties.\\nIf the court is satisfied, after taking into account, on the basis of 171 information placed before it, that the accused has his roots in the community and is not likely to abscond, it can safely release the accused on his personal bond.\\n[177 E, G, H] 5.\\nTo determine whether the accused has his roots in the community which would deter him from fleeing, the court should take into account the following factors concerning the accused: (1) The length of his residence in the community, (2) his employment status, history and his financial condition, (3) his family ties and relationships, (4) his reputation, character and monetary conditions, (5) his prior criminal record including any record of prior release on recognizance or on bail, (6) the identity of responsible members of the community who would vouch for his reliability, (7) the nature of the offence charged and the apparent probability of conviction and the likely sentence in so far as these factors are relevant to the risk of non appearance, and (8) any other factors indicating the ties of the accused to the community or bearing on the risk of wilful failure to appear.\\n[178 A E] If the court is satisfied on a consideration of the relevant factors that the accused has his ties in the community and there is no substantial risk of non appearance, the accused may, as far as possible, be released on his personal bond.\\nIf facts are brought to the notice of the court showing that, having regard to the condition and back ground of the accused, his previous record and the nature and circumstances of the offence, there may be a substantial risk of his non appearance at the trial, as for example, where the accused is a notorious bad character or a confirmed criminal or the offence is serious, the court may not release the accused on his personal bond and may insist on bail with sureties.\\nBut in the majority of cases, considerations like family ties and relationship, roots in the community, employment status etc. may prevail with the court in releasing the accused on his personal bond and particularly in cases where the offence is not grave and the accused is poor or belongs to a weaker section of the community, release on personal bond could, as far as possible, be preferred.\\nBut even while releasing the accused on personal bond it is necessary to caution the court that the amount of the bond which it fixes should not be based merely on the nature of the charge.\\nThe decision as regards the amount of the bond should be an individualised decision depending on the individual financial circumstances of the accused and the probability of his absconding.\\nThe amount of the bond should be determined having regard to these relevant factors and should not be fixed mechanically according to a schedule keyed to the nature of the charge.\\nOtherwise, it would be difficult for the accused to secure his release even by executing a personal bond, it would be very harsh and oppressive if he is required to satisfy the court and what is said in regard to the court must apply equally in relation to the police while granting bail that he is solvent enough to pay the amount of the bond if he fails to appear at the trial and in consequence the bond is forfeited.\\nThe inquiry into the solvency of the accused can become a source of great harassment to him and often result in denial of bail and deprivation of liberty and should not, therefore, be insisted upon as a condition of acceptance of the personal bond.\\n[178 F 179 D] 6.\\nNecessary to provide by an amendment of the penal law that if an accused wilfully fails to appear in compliance with the promise contained in his personal bond, he shall be liable to penal action.\\n[177 F] 7.\\nHigh time that the State Government realised its responsibility to the people in the matter of administration of justice and set up more courts for the trial of cases.\\n[180 H] 172 Pathak J. (concurring) (1) The primary principle of criminal law is that imprisonment may follow a judgment of guilt, but should not precede it.\\nThere is also another principle which makes it desirable to ensure that the accused is present to receive his sentence in the event of being found guilty.\\n[181 E] (2) It is indisputable that an unnecessarily prolonged detention in prison of undertrials before being brought to trial is an affront to all civilized norms of human liberty and any meaningful concept of individual liberty which forms the bedrock of a civilized legal system must view with distress patently long periods of imprisonment before persons awaiting trial can receive the attention of the administration of justice.\\n[181 D] (3) The Code of Criminal Procedure both the old Code and the new include provisions for the release of a person on bail or on the execution of a bond without sureties for his appearance.\\nThere is an amplitude of judicial power to release a prisoner awaiting trial on bail or on the execution of a personal bond without sureties for his appearance within the existing provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and it is for the Courts to fully acquaint themselves with the nature and extent of their discretion in exercising it.\\nIt is no longer possible to countenance a mechanical exercise of the power.\\nWhat should be the amount of security required or the monetary obligation demanded in a bond is a matter calling for the careful consideration of several factors.\\nThe entire object being only to ensure that the undertrial does not flee or hide himself from trial, all the relevant considerations which enter into the determination of that question must be taken into account.\\n[181 E, 182 B C] (4) The abuses attendant on the prevailing system of pre trial release in India could be avoided or, in any event greatly reduced, if considerations like \"nature and circumstances of the offence charged, the weight of the evidence against the accused, the accused \\'s family ties, employment, financial resources, character and mental condition, the length of his residence in the community, his record of convictions, and his record or appearance at court proceedings or of flight to avoid prosecution or failure to appear at court proceedings\", are taken into consideration when determining pre trial release and the amount of security or monetary obligation to be imposed.\\n[182 G, E F] United States Bail Reforms Act, 1966: 18 USS 3146 (b), Moti Ram & Ors.\\nvs State of M.P. ; ; referred to.\\n(5) Urgent need for a clear and explicit provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling the release, in appropriate cases, of an under trial prisoner on his bond without sureties and without any monetary obligation.[183 B]\\n', 'The first respondent, M/s Shanmughavilas Cashew Indus tries, shipped 4445 bags of raw cashewnuts from East Africa to Cochin in the vessel Steliosm chartered by the appellant M/s British India Steam Navigation Co.
